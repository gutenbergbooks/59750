<h2 class="oneline">Translator&rsquo;s Preface</h2>
<p>Many years ago Karl Friedrich Becker
wrote a series of romances of the ancient
world for German boys and girls, of
which &ldquo;Ulysses&rdquo; and &ldquo;Achilles&rdquo; in the present
series of &ldquo;Life Stories for Young People&rdquo; form an
important part. They became great favorites in
their day and still preserve their interest, so that in
a sense they may be called classics. The masterly
manner in which the author has presented the old
gods and heroes from the human point of view and
the atmosphere of the old days of mythology, as
well as the thrill of the adventurous narrative and
the deep human interest of the story, should commend
them also to American boys and girls. None
of the ancient stories is more entrancing than that of
Ulysses and the vicissitudes he had to endure in
his effort to return to Ithaca after the Trojan war,
and of the patience, sweetness, and faithfulness of
Penelope, as she waited year after year for the
return of her lord, while her life was made wretched
by the unwelcome and often brutal solicitations of
her numerous suitors, as well as of her final happiness
when Ulysses returned and wreaked deserved
vengeance upon her persecutors. Incidentally also
the reader will enjoy the charming descriptions of
his adventures with Calypso and the beautiful
Nausicaa, his escape from the monstrous Cyclops,
the fascinating Circe, and his thrilling experiences
in passing Scylla and Charybdis. It is a story
replete with interest, delightfully told.</p>

After a siege of ten long years the united
forces of the Greeks had sacked and
burned the city. The princes, having thus satisfied
their thirst for revenge, now longed for home,
and putting to sea with their ships, soon sailed
away with their companions. Some reached home
in safety, others were tossed to and fro upon stormy
seas, wandered about for years, and never succeeded
in reaching their native land. Agamemnon,
the bravest of the surviving heroes, met a still more
terrible fate. Joyfully he had gazed once more
upon his ancestral home, and thanking the gods
for his safe return, hastened impetuously to the
arms of his beloved spouse Clytemnestra, not knowing
that the faithless one had wed another during
his absence. The false one received him with feigned
tenderness and presented him with a refreshing
draught; he disrobed, drank with deep emotion
from the old familiar goblet, and stretched his
weary limbs luxuriously upon the soft cushions.
Alas! while the unsuspecting hero slept, the despoiler
of his fortune and his spouse suddenly fell
upon him with a sword and slew him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">12</div>
<p>How different is the story of the noble Penelope,
the beautiful wife of Ulysses! He was king of the
isle of Ithaca, off the western coast of Greece, and
had been drawn into the war against Troy. Ever
since her husband had set sail, a number of the young
princes of Ithaca and the neighboring islands had
beset her with proposals for her hand. She was
young and beautiful and had great wealth in sheep
and cattle, goats and swine, so that whoever wed
her might hope, by taking Ulysses&rsquo; place as chief of
the island, to rule over the minor princes. This
was a tempting prospect and the young men used
every means in their power to persuade the beautiful
queen to return to her father&rsquo;s house as a widow,
so that they might formally demand her hand
according to ancient custom. Ulysses, they said,
would never return. But it was not easy for the
suitors to banish the image of her beloved husband
from the heart of this devoted wife. She could not so
lightly break the tie in which she had found her youthful
happiness. He will surely return, she thought,
and though she wept day and night for fear and longing,
this hope cheered her anxious soul. Year after
year passed and still the war went on. At last news
reached Ithaca that Troy had fallen and the heroes
were returning. Fresh hope now filled the heart of
the faithful wife, but another year passed, and still
another, and no ship brought back her lord.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_13">13</div>
<p>Penelope talked with every stranger who came to
Ithaca and asked for news of the hero. His companions
were said to have returned long ago&mdash;Nestor
to Pylos, Menelaus to Sparta; no one knew
what had become of Ulysses or whether he was dead
or living. For nine years longer the poor woman
nursed her grief, until nineteen years had passed
since she had seen her lord. He had left her with a
nursling, now grown into a handsome lad, who was
her only consolation, but much too impotent to cope
with the presumptuous rabble, which became each
year more insistent and at length hit upon a cruel
means of forcing the poor lady to return to her
father&rsquo;s house. They leagued themselves with the
princes of the neighborhood, over a hundred in number,
and agreed that they would all assemble each
morning at Ulysses&rsquo; palace, there to consume the
produce of his herds and granaries and to drink his
wines, until his heir, Telemachus, for fear of becoming
impoverished, should be compelled to thrust
his faithful mother from the door and thus force
her into another marriage. Thenceforth the great
halls of Ulysses&rsquo; palace were filled from morning till
night with these uninvited guests, who compelled
the king&rsquo;s servants to do their bidding. They took
what they wanted and mocked the owners with
loud shouts and laughter. The herds were diminishing
perceptibly, the abundance of grain and wine
disappearing, and there was no one able to check
the robbers. Penelope sat in her upper chamber
at her loom and wept; Telemachus was derided
whenever he showed himself among the insolent
crowd.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">14</div>
<p>A god had brought this woe upon Ulysses&rsquo; house.
Poseidon, ruler of the sea, was angry at the hero,
who had sorely offended him. Therefore he drove
him from south to north and from east to west
upon the broad seas, dashed his ships to pieces,
killed his companions, and forced him through whirlpools
and canyons to strange peoples. And now,
while his insolent neighbors were consuming his
substance, he was held a prisoner upon a lonely
island far from home, where reigned Calypso, a
daughter of the gods. She desired him for her husband,
but Ulysses brooded continually upon his dear
country, his wife, and son. He went daily to the
shore, and seated himself mournfully by the surf,
wishing for nothing more ardently than that he might
see the smoke ascending from his own hearth before
he died.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">15</div>
<p>The gods in high Olympus were touched, especially
his friend Athene. One day, when they were
all assembled in their vast halls and the unfriendly
Poseidon happened to be absent among the Ethiopians,
Athene seized the opportunity to relate the
story of the sad plight of Ulysses and Penelope to
father Jupiter. The king of the gods was filled with
compassion and gladly granted his daughter&rsquo;s request
that she might be permitted to visit Telemachus
in disguise, to breathe courage into his
soul, and that Hermes should be sent to the isle of
Ogygia to transmit the command of the gods to
Calypso to release immediately her prisoner. Athene
straightway prepared for the journey. She bound
her golden sandals upon her feet, took her mighty
lance in her hand, and descending like the wind
upon Ithaca, stood suddenly before Telemachus&rsquo;
lofty gateway, in the guise of Mentor, the Taphian
king. Here she saw with amazement the wild company
of wanton suitors feasting and drinking, gambling
and shouting, and the servants of Telemachus
waiting upon them, carving the meat, washing
the tables, and pouring wine and mixing it with
water after the ancient custom. Among them,
taking no part in their revels, sat Telemachus, with
a heavy heart. He no sooner saw the stranger at
the gate than he went to meet him, gave him his
hand, and, greeting him kindly, took his lance. He
then conducted the unknown guest into the dwelling,
but not among the revellers, so that his meal
should not be disturbed by their riotous behavior.
The stranger was placed upon a dais, with a footstool
under his feet. Telemachus seated himself
beside him, and at a sign a servant immediately
brought a golden ewer and a silver basin, bathed
their hands, and placed a polished table before them.
The stewardess brought bread and meat, while a
lusty servant poured the wine.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">16</div>
<p>Not until the stranger had been refreshed with
food and drink did Telemachus ask his name and the
object of his journey. &ldquo;I am Mentor, the son of
Alcimus, and rule the Taphians,&rdquo; said the disguised
goddess. &ldquo;I have come hither on my way
to Temesa, in a ship which lies at anchor in the bay,
and as Ulysses and I are old friends, I wished in
passing to pay thee a visit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thereupon Telemachus told the story of his
wrongs to his guest. The goddess listened attentively,
just as though she had not known it all
before. She advised him to adopt a manly attitude
in public assemblage, boldly to forbid the suitors
the house, and, above all, to set out for Sparta and
Pylos, where lived the valiant heroes Nestor and
Menelaus, Ulysses&rsquo; companions in the siege of
Troy. There he might learn where they had parted
from his father and where he was now most likely
to be found; &ldquo;for a divine inspiration tells me that
he is not dead,&rdquo; added Mentor. &ldquo;He is indeed
far away, shipwrecked and held by cruel captors,
but thou shalt certainly see him again if thou wilt
follow my advice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The youth began to love and revere his father&rsquo;s
old friend. In accordance with the ancient rites
of hospitality, he offered him a gift at his departure,
which was declined on the plea of haste. He promised
to come again on his return voyage, however,
when he would take the gift with him. Upon this, he
disappeared suddenly like a bird, and for the first
time Telemachus suspected that he had been entertaining
a divinity. He pondered all that the stranger
had said, and determined to follow the divine
counsel. He began at once to protest against the
suitors&rsquo; demeanor, and they, never having seen him
appear so manly before, were astonished at his
boldness. Antinous and Eurymachus, however, the
most insolent among them all, mocked at his words
and soon had them all laughing at him. They spent
the evening in song and dance, and when night
came dispersed as usual to their own dwellings.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">17</div>
<p>Telemachus also went to his sleeping chamber,
accompanied by his faithful old nurse, Euryclea,
carrying a flaming torch before him. He threw
off his soft flowing garment and tossed it to the old
dame who, folding it carefully, hung it on the wooden
peg by his bed. Telemachus threw himself upon
his couch and wrapped himself in the woollen covers.
The old dame retired, barring the doors.</p>
<p>As soon as morning dawned Telemachus sprang
from his couch, dressed himself, laced his sandals,
and girded on his sword. Thus apparelled, the stately
youth sallied forth. He sent out heralds to summon
the populace to assemble, and when the crowd
had gathered in close ranks, he went among them
bearing his lance and accompanied by two swift-footed
dogs. Then to the amazement of all, Telemachus
stepped forth, caused the heralds to bring
him the sceptre, as a sign that he wished to speak,
and began as follows: &ldquo;I have called you, people
of Ithaca, because the deep distress of my house
impels me. My father, as you know, is far away,
perhaps forever lost to me. I am forced to endure
every day a swarm of unmannerly guests intrenching
themselves in my house, who pretend to court
my mother, while they maliciously consume my
substance and will soon make a beggar of the king&rsquo;s
son. Unhappy one! I need a man such as Ulysses
was to purge my house of this plague. Therefore I
pray you to resent the wrong. Be ashamed before
your neighbors and fear the vengeance of the gods.
Did my good father ever intentionally offend you,
and am I not already unhappy enough in losing
him?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">18</div>
<p>At these words tears overcame him and he dashed
the sceptre to the ground. Pity and compassion
seized upon the assemblage. All were silent except
the most determined of the suitors, Antinous, who
answered insolently: &ldquo;Bold-tongued youth, what
sayest thou? Wouldst thou make us hateful in
the eyes of the people? Who but thyself is to blame
for thy troubles? Why dost thou not send away
thy mother and why does she not go willingly?
Has she not mocked us with subterfuges and kept
us in suspense for more than three years? Did
she not say: &lsquo;Delay the wedding until I shall have
finished weaving the shroud for my old father-in-law,
Laertes, that the women may not censure me
if the old man, who in life possessed such riches,
should be carried out unclothed&rsquo;? And what did
the crafty lady do? She wove day after day, but
the garment was never finished, and at length we
learned the secret from one of her women. By
lamp-light she undid the work of the day. Then we
compelled her to finish it, and now we demand that
she shall keep her promise. Thou must immediately
command her to return to her father&rsquo;s house
and take for her husband whoever pleases her or
one whom her father shall select for her. If thou
doest this, none of us will molest thee further; but
we shall not retire until she has chosen a bridegroom
from among the Achaians.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">19</div>
<p>Telemachus spurned the proposal with righteous
indignation. Once more he besought the suitors
to spare his house and threatened them with the
vengeance of the gods. But they only mocked at
him and everyone who took his part. He then proposed
that a ship should be fitted out, so that he
might sail to Pylos and Sparta to seek his father,
and if in a year&rsquo;s time he should have heard nothing
of him, he promised that his mother should wed
with whom she would.</p>
<p>This proposal was received with scorn, and the
assembly broke up. Sadly Telemachus wandered
down to the sea, bathed his hands in the dark waters,
and prayed to the goddess who had appeared to
him the day before. Behold, as he stood there
alone, Mentor, his father&rsquo;s old friend, came toward
him. He also had been amongst the people and had
heard with anger the defiant language of the suitors.
Indeed he had arisen to speak for Telemachus, but
their mocking cries prevented him; and now he
reappeared, as Telemachus believed, to assist him in
carrying out his plans.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_20">20</div>
<p>Mentor, or rather Athene, encouraged him,
urged him not to delay the journey, and even offered
to supply a ship and crew. Telemachus went
straight home, confided his plan to his old nurse
Euryclea, and ordered her to provide wine in jars,
meal in skins, and whatever else was needful for the
voyage. The tender-hearted old dame wept bitterly
when she saw the delicate youth prepare to
start on such a long and dangerous journey. She
begged him a thousand times to give it up and await
his father&rsquo;s arrival at home. He was manfully
resolute, however, and the nurse was obliged to
promise to keep his departure a secret&mdash;not even
to tell his mother until she should have missed him.</p>
<p>Athene, in Mentor&rsquo;s shape, was meanwhile employed
in hiring a ship and oarsmen, so that by
evening everything was in readiness. When the
suitors had retired and everyone was asleep, Mentor
took Telemachus secretly away. The youths
carried the provisions down to the ship, raised the
mast, and bound it fast with ropes. Then the rowers
came aboard and loosed the ship from shore. Athene
had seated herself by the side of Telemachus. The
oars splashed gayly on the quiet surface of the
sea. The silent night encompassed them, and only
the twinkling stars illumined with a faint light the
dark waters through which the vessel was being
swiftly propelled.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_21">21</div>
<h2 id="c2"><span class="h2line1">Chapter II</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">Telemachus visits Nestor and Menelaus&mdash;The Suitors prepare an Ambush</span></h2>
<p>At sunrise the travellers saw Pylos before
them, a little town on the western coast
of Peloponnesus, or the present peninsula
of Morea. It was the home of the venerable Nestor,
who lived amongst his subjects like a father
with his children. His descendants were numerous
and all the people reverenced his opinion, and loved
him for his kindness and benignity, and the recital
of his adventures whiled away many an hour for
the eager youths who hung upon his words.</p>
<p>On the morning when Telemachus and his companions
were nearing Pylos, Nestor had summoned
his people to the shore to offer up a great sacrifice
to Poseidon. These thousands of festive people,
ranged in nine columns each composed of five hundred
men, made a wonderful picture. Each column
had contributed nine bulls which, having been offered
up, were now smouldering on the altars, while
the people were feasting upon the residue.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">22</div>
<p>Athene and young Telemachus disembarked, and,
leaving the ship in the care of the rowers, set out on
foot toward the scene of festivity. The divine
guide encouraged the timid youth to address the
old man boldly and instructed him what to say and
how to conduct himself.</p>
<p>Scarcely had the men of Pylos caught sight of
them when a group of youths hastened forward to
welcome them, holding out their hands in friendly
greeting, according to the hospitable custom of
ancient times. Pisistratus, Nestor&rsquo;s youngest son,
was the most cordial of them all. He took both
strangers by the hand and led them to soft seats
upon sheepskins beside his father and his brother,
Thrasymedes, bringing meat and wine to refresh
the weary guests. He then filled a golden goblet,
quaffed it in Athene&rsquo;s honor, and spoke to her as
follows: &ldquo;Dear guest, join us, I pray thee, in our
joyful sacrifice; it is offered to Poseidon, ruler of the
sea. Pour out this wine to the mighty god and pray
to him for our welfare! No man can do without
the gods! And when thou hast offered sacrifice and
drunk of the wine, then give thy friend the goblet
that he also may pray for us. Thou art the older,
therefore I have offered the cup first to thee.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">23</div>
<p>Athene was pleased with these modest and courteous
words. She took the cup, poured a few drops
on the ground, and prayed: &ldquo;Hear me, Poseidon;
deign to prosper every good work which we shall
undertake. Crown Nestor and his sons with honor
and graciously reward the men of Pylos for the holy
sacrifice which they have offered before thee to-day.
And graciously prosper my friend and me in the
enterprise which has brought us hither!&rdquo; Thus
she prayed, and while still speaking, by reason of
her divine power, she secretly granted the prayer.
Then Telemachus received the cup from her hand
and drank, also offering sacrifice and prayer for the
feasting people.</p>
<p>Not until the guests had partaken of food did the
venerable Nestor consider it proper to inquire the
name and business of the strangers. Telemachus
told him the object of their journey and conjured
the old man to tell him all he knew about his noble
father, urging him not to conceal anything, however
terrible, that would give him certainty as to his
fate. Then Nestor began, with the garrulity of
old age, to relate the adventures of the heroes and
the story of his own return. But Telemachus
could draw no comfort from these tales, for what
he most wished to learn was what Nestor knew no
better than himself. The old man advised him to
go to Menelaus at Sparta, who of all the heroes
had been longest on the way, and having only lately
reached home, would certainly be able to give him
news of Ulysses&rsquo; fate. Mentor approved of this
proposal, and the journey to Sparta was determined
upon. As by this time night was beginning to fall,
the goddess reminded her young friend that it was
time to set out. The sons of Nestor filled the cups
once more and the customary offerings were made
to Poseidon and the immortal gods. Then Mentor
and Telemachus arose to go down to their vessel.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">24</div>
<p>&ldquo;The gods forbid!&rdquo; cried Nestor, when he saw
them about to depart. &ldquo;Shall my guests spend the
day with me and go away to pass the night in a
musty vessel, as though I were a poor man, who
had no cloaks nor warm covers in my house? No,
my friends, I have plenty of soft cushions and fine
garments, and the son of my old friend Ulysses shall
not thus depart so long as I live! And even when I
am gone, there will always be sons to pay honor to
the stranger within my gates.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well said,&rdquo; answered Mentor. &ldquo;Telemachus
must accept thy hospitality. Let him go with thee
to lodge in thy palace, but I must hasten to the shore
to pass the night with the young sailors and look
after their welfare. Very early in the morning I
must pay a visit to the valiant Cauconians to settle
an old debt. In the meanwhile do thou send Telemachus
with thy sons to Sparta and provide him
with a chariot and fleet horses for the journey.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With these words Mentor turned and in the shape
of an eagle swung himself up into the air. All
were amazed, but Nestor immediately recognized
the goddess; for he knew how many times in the
past she had aided Ulysses. &ldquo;Take courage,&rdquo; he
said to Telemachus, &ldquo;for thou seest that the gods
are with thee. And thou, divine Athene, have mercy
upon us all and crown us with fame and renown!
Behold! I vow to thee each year a bull, broad of
forehead and without blemish, which has never been
under the yoke.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">25</div>
<p>The people dispersed, and Nestor returned to
his dwelling with his sons and their guest. On
their arrival wine was again offered up and drunk,
and then Pisistratus conducted Telemachus to a
couch beside his own in the pillared hall. The other
sons, being married, had their quarters in the interior
of the house.</p>
<p>As soon as morning dawned the sons and their
venerable father arose and assembled on the stone
seats before the portal to discuss the proposed
journey. Nestor presently sent some of his sons
to select the offering which he had promised Athene.
One was sent to the vessel to fetch all of Telemachus&rsquo;
rowers except two, another to order a goldsmith
to gild the horns of the victim, a third to command
the shepherd to seek out and bring up an ox of the
promised quality, and another finally to notify the
maidens to prepare a banquet.</p>
<p>It was not long before the goldsmith appeared,
also the rowers, and the shepherd soon brought the
desired animal. When the goldsmith had finished
gilding the horns of the ox, two of the sons led it
into the circle. Nestor, having sprinkled himself
with water, cut off the animal&rsquo;s forelock and cast
it with prayer on the flaming altar, strewing consecrated
barley upon the ground. And now the mighty
Thrasymedes advanced and struck a heavy blow
with a sharp axe, which sundered the tendons of the
animal&rsquo;s neck and it fell stunned to the ground.
Perseus caught the gushing blood in a vessel, while
Pisistratus completed the slaughter of the victim.
The others now came up to carve the beef. They
cut off the shanks, wrapped them well in strips of
fat, and laid them on the altar fire to send up delicious
odors to the goddess, sprinkled wine upon and
roasted the other pieces for the offering, turning
them upon spits. Other youths cut up the remainder
and roasted it carefully for the feast.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">26</div>
<p>When all was prepared Telemachus appeared in
the midst of the company beautiful as a god. He
had bathed, anointed himself with oil, and wrapped
himself in a rich mantle. The company sat down in
a circle to enjoy the magnificent feast, and when
they had eaten their fill, Nestor reminded his sons
that it was time to depart. They quickly harnessed
two horses to a chariot, while a servant stowed
away bread, wine, and meat for the journey. Telemachus
took his place on the seat with Pisistratus
beside him holding the reins and whip. They travelled
rapidly all day and at eve reached Pher&aelig;, the
dwelling of the good Diodes, who hospitably entertained
them. On the second day they arrived at
the castle of Menelaus in Laced&aelig;mon, having recognized
his dominions by the broad fields of wheat.
Pisistratus drew up his prancing steeds before the
gateway of the castle, and the two strangers sprang
hurriedly out.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">27</div>
<p>They heard sounds of revelry within. The voice
of a singer was accompanied by the sweet tones of a
stringed instrument, and through the open gateway
they saw a crowd of guests in the centre of which
two dancers were moving in time to the music.
This was a great day in Menelaus&rsquo; palace. The old
hero was celebrating the marriage of two of his
children. There was so much noise and confusion
within that the clatter of the chariot had not been
noticed. A servant by chance saw the strangers
at the gate. &ldquo;Two strange youths of kingly
mien are without. Shall I unharness their horses,&rdquo;
he asked, &ldquo;or shall I bid them drive on to seek
hospitality elsewhere?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo; cried Menelaus angrily, &ldquo;how canst
thou ask such childish questions. Have we not
ourselves received many gifts and been kindly entertained
amongst strangers? Go quickly, take out
the horses, and bring the men in to the feast!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The servant obeyed, and Telemachus and Pisistratus
were conducted into the hall. They were
astonished at the splendor of the palace, for Menelaus
had returned with great possessions. Maid servants
conducted them to the bath, and when they
had anointed themselves, they donned their tunics
and cloaks and took their places on raised seats
beside the host. Servants appeared at once with
small tables and food. One poured water over their
hands from a golden ewer into a silver basin, while
another brought wine, meat, and bread. &ldquo;Now
eat and drink with us,&rdquo; cried Menelaus; &ldquo;afterward
shall you tell me who you are, for I perceive
that ye are no common men.&rdquo; With these words
he placed a fine fat piece of roast, his own special
portion, upon their plates, and the youths found it
a delicious morsel.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_28">28</div>
<p>Menelaus gazed at them intently. He remarked
with satisfaction that they were astonished at the
magnificence of his hall and of the utensils, and he
saw how they called each other&rsquo;s attention secretly
to new objects. This induced him to speak of his
travels, of the perils to which he had been exposed
for eight years after the Trojan war, and of the
persons he had met who had presented him with
the costly objects by which he was now surrounded.
In his recital he often referred to the hardships of
the Trojan war, while the mention of the ignominious
death of his brother, Agamemnon, caused him
to shed bitter tears. &ldquo;But,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;I
would bear all this with patience if only I might
have kept my friend, dearer to me than all the
rest, the noble Ulysses, with whom I have shared
good and evil days! Or if I but knew that he was
safe and could have him near me! I would endow
him with a city that we might live side by side and
commune with each other daily until death should
part us. But the gods alone know whether he is
alive or dead. Perhaps his old father, his chaste
wife, and his son Telemachus are even now mourning
him as dead!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Telemachus hid his tears behind his cloak. Menelaus
saw this and was uncertain whether to question
him or to leave him to his grief. Just then his
spouse, the once beautiful Helen, entered the hall
accompanied by her maidens, one of whom brought
her a chair, another carried the soft woollen carpet
for her feet, a third her silver work basket. She
seated herself near the strangers, observed them
attentively, and then said to her husband: &ldquo;Hast
thou inquired the names of our guests? I should
say that two people were never more alike than this
youth is unto the noble Ulysses.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">29</div>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed it is true,&rdquo; answered the hero. &ldquo;He
has the hands, the feet, the eyes, and hair of Ulysses.
And just now while I was speaking of our old friend,
the hot tears sprang from the youth&rsquo;s lids and he
hid his face in the folds of his purple mantle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thou art quite right, Menelaus, godlike ruler,&rdquo;
interrupted Pisistratus. &ldquo;This is truly the son of
Ulysses, but he is a modest youth and did not wish
to make himself known at once with boastful speech.
My father, Nestor, hath sent me with him thither
that thou mightest give him tidings of his noble
father and advice, for he is sore beset at home and
there is none among the people to rise up and avert
disaster from him.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">30</div>
<p>Menelaus would now have rejoiced over the youth
had not sad memories of his lost friend overwhelmed
him. He wept, Helen also, and Telemachus still
sobbed, while young Pisistratus was much moved.
For a while they gave themselves up to their grief
until Menelaus proposed that they should talk the
matter over on the morrow and should now banish
these sorrowful thoughts and return to the feast.
This sensible advice was approved by all. A servant
at once laved the hands of the guests, and they
began once more to eat and drink. Helen, who was
an adept at various arts, secretly poured a magic
powder into the wine. It was a wonderful spice
given her by an Egyptian princess, which had the
property of deadening every discomfort or sorrow
and cheering the soul, even though a father and
mother, brother or sister, or even one&rsquo;s own son
had been killed before one&rsquo;s eyes. They all drank
of it and became gay. Helen told many amusing
tales of the craftiness of Ulysses which she had
herself experienced. For while she was still in
Ilium he had come into the city in disguise to spy
out the plans of the Trojans. No one recognized
him, and only to Helen did he discover himself and
confide the plans of the Greeks. Menelaus also
told how they had been concealed within the wooden
horse and would scarcely have withstood Helen&rsquo;s
call had Ulysses not restrained them. While the
evening was thus being passed in confidential talk,
Helen had a couch prepared in the hall with cushions
and soft covers for the guests and a herald conducted
them thither with a torch. Menelaus and
his spouse, however, slept in the interior of the
palace.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_31">31</div>
<p>Not until morning did the host ask his guests
their business. Telemachus told him the story of
the insolent suitors, and begged Menelaus for some
news of his father. &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; cried the hero when he
had heard the tale, &ldquo;it shall be as though the doe
had left her young in the lion&rsquo;s cave and had gone
away to graze upon the hills. When the lion returns
and finds the strange brood, he destroys them.
Thus will Ulysses return to his house and make a
terrible end of those trespassers! Could they but
see him in the majesty of his power as he once threw
Philomelides in Lesbos, then truly they would have
little stomach for courting. But, dear youth, as
thou hast asked me, I will tell thee what the old
prophet Proteus in Egypt once told me of him.
On my return voyage angry gods detained me for
twenty days on an island at the mouth of the Nile,
for I had carelessly forgotten to make the customary
offering of atonement. Our food was nearly
gone, my companions lost courage, and I should
perhaps have perished with them had a goddess not
taken pity on me. Idothea, the lovely daughter
of Proteus, looked upon us with compassion, and
once when I had wandered far from the others,
she came and spoke to me. Then I told her my
plight, and begged her to tell me some means of
gaining the favor of the heavenly powers to discern
which of the gods was hindering my journey and how
I might reach home through the endless leagues of
ocean.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_32">32</div>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Gladly, oh stranger,&rsquo; said she, &lsquo;will I tell thee
of an unfailing means. Thou knowest that my
father, the old sea god, Proteus, is omniscient, and
if thou canst surprise him by some cunning scheme
he might easily tell thee all that thou wishest to
know.&rsquo; &lsquo;Good,&rsquo; said I; &lsquo;but tell me what means
I can employ to ensnare him.&rsquo; &lsquo;Listen,&rsquo; answered
the goddess; &lsquo;every day when the sun is at the zenith
the god rises from the sea, and comes on shore
to sleep in the cool grottoes. With him come also
the seals to sun themselves upon the shore. Therefore,
if thou wouldst approach him unseen thou must
conceal thyself in the skin of a seal and take thy
place amongst the others. I will help thee. Come
here early to-morrow morning with three picked
companions, and I will furnish you all with glossy
skins. When my father comes up, the first thing
he does is to count his seals as a shepherd counts
his sheep; then he lies down amongst them. As
soon as thou seest that he has fallen asleep it is
time to use force. You must all seize him and hold
him fast, not letting go, no matter how he struggles
to free himself. He will use all his arts of transformation
to get away, now as fire, now as water,
and now as some rapacious animal. But ye must
not cease to contend with him until he shall have
reassumed his proper form. Then loose the bonds,
and let him tell thee what thou wishest to know.&rsquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_33">33</div>
<p>&ldquo;As soon as Idothea had said this she disappeared
into the depths of the sea. I went to my
ship and spent the night in anxious vigil, and in the
morning I picked out three men of proven strength
and bravery to accompany me in this wonderful
adventure. We went to the appointed place, and
behold! the nymph kept her word. She arose out
of the sea with four fresh sealskins, enveloped us
each in one of them, and showed us where to lie
down. Friends, you cannot imagine our plight.
The oily smell of the skins would certainly have
overcome us had not Idothea rubbed sweet-smelling
ambrosia upon them to smother the horrible odors.
Thus unpleasantly masquerading we passed the
whole morning, until at last, in the heat of the noonday,
the troop of seals rose out of the water, and
after them came the gray god of the sea. He looked
about, examined and counted his seals, ourselves
with the rest, and then laid himself down in their
midst. Very soon we sprang up with loud cries and
held him down with all our strength. Everything
transpired as his daughter had warned us. He suddenly
transformed himself into a lion to frighten
us, but we were not to be thus outwitted and only
held the tighter. Then he became a panther, then
a dragon, and finally, a bristly boar. While we
thought we were grasping the bristles he tried to
escape us as water, and scarcely had we dammed
up the water when he rose into the air in the form of
a tree. At last the old magician became weary of
these changes, resumed his true shape, and said:
&lsquo;Son of Atreus, what mortal has discovered to thee
the art of holding me&mdash;and what dost thou want
of me?&rsquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_34">34</div>
<p>&ldquo;I told him my perplexities. He bade me return
to Egypt and there propitiate the offended gods
with rich offerings. He promised that my return
voyage should be successful. I asked one last
question of the god: What had become of my friends,
and had they all reached home safely? He then
began a long story which caused me to weep bitter
tears. He spoke of Ajax and his sad fate. He told
me of my dear brother Agamemnon&rsquo;s horrible
death. My heart was broken; I no longer wished
to live. But the venerable god comforted me and
commanded me to hasten home to avenge this
wrong. Finally I asked the fate of my dear friend
Ulysses and whether he still lived. Proteus
answered: &lsquo;Ulysses lives, but is held a prisoner far
from here on an island, by the nymph Calypso. He
weeps tears of home-sickness and longing, and would
gladly intrust himself to the unknown waters, but
he has no ship and no men, and the nymph who
loves him will never let him go.&rsquo; Thus Proteus
prophesied to me, then suddenly sank into the sea.
I followed Proteus&rsquo; commands and arrived safely
at home. Now thou knowest all that I can tell
thee. Remain thou with me for a while, then I will
send thee home with worthy gifts,&mdash;three splendid
horses and a cunningly carved chariot,&mdash;and
in addition I will present thee with a beautiful goblet
in which thou canst make offerings to the gods,
so that thou shalt always remember me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Telemachus declined the invitation, for he could
not desert his companions whom he had left in
Pylos, anxiously awaiting his return. In the morning
the king had prepared for the two youths a
bountiful farewell repast of freshly killed goats
and lambs. Telemachus would scarcely have
enjoyed this early meal if he had known
what the wicked suitors at home were preparing
for him. They learned with deep concern that
Telemachus had really had the courage to undertake
the journey. Who could tell but he might
return with help from Nestor or Menelaus and put
them all to death? Until now no one had given the
boy credit for much courage, but now&mdash;was it
not as though the father&rsquo;s spirit had been awakened
in the son? Antinous, the most insolent of
them all, cried: &ldquo;No! we must not allow the youth
to defy us! He must be crushed before he can harm
us. Give me a ship and man it with twenty brave
warriors. I will row out to meet him and waylay
him in the straits between Ithaca and Samos. If I
meet him he will never see this house again alive,
and then all will be ours.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_35">35</div>
<p>All applauded the wicked Antinous and conferred
as to how they might most surely destroy
the youth, and when all was arranged the ship rowed
away to the appointed place to await Telemachus.
Medon the herald had overheard the plot, and hastened
to acquaint Penelope with the sad news.
Her heart was already heavy with anxiety, and at
this fresh misfortune her knees began to tremble
and she sank unconscious on the threshold of her
chamber. Her maidens wept over her, and at last
tears sprang to the eyes of the beautiful queen.
She moaned aloud and could not compose herself.
At first she thought of sending for her father-in-law,
Laertes; but the old man was as powerless as
she. Then she considered other succor, but all
was useless. At last to her oppressed heart came
the comforting inspiration of calling upon a god for
protection. She prayed fervently to Athene, and
when she had finished she felt renewed strength
and composure. She sank down upon her couch
in a deep sleep.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_36">36</div>
<p>Athene heard her prayer, and desiring not to
leave the good lady comfortless, sent her a pleasant
dream. Penelope&rsquo;s sister appeared to the
sleeper, and asked the cause of her grief. Penelope
was comforted in telling her woes, and the dream
figure put courage into her soul with the consoling
words: &ldquo;Be comforted, sister, and pluck these cowardly
fears from thy heart. Thy son will return.
He has a guide and companion such as many a one
might wish for. Pallas Athene herself is with him,
and she has compassion on him and on thee and has
also sent me to tell thee this.&rdquo; Penelope wished
to ask other things, but the dream figure vanished.
She then awoke, was comforted, and no longer
bemoaned the fate of the two loved ones whom she
had thought were lost.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_37">37</div>
<h2 id="c3"><span class="h2line1">Chapter III</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">Calypso allows Ulysses to go home&mdash;Poseidon sends a storm&mdash;Ulysses is wrecked upon the Island of Scheria</span></h2>
<p>Athene was busy preparing Ulysses&rsquo; return.
Hermes, messenger of the gods, bound on
the golden sandals which enabled him to
soar like a bird through the air, took up his magic
serpent staff with which he could both kill and restore
people to life, and flew swiftly away across
the sea. He soon stood upon Calypso&rsquo;s distant
island, enchanted with the lovely dwelling so charmingly
nestling among the trees. Singing birds had
made their nests in the dark recesses of the foliage,
and the entrance to the grotto was framed in vines
from which hung bunches of purple grapes. Round
about stretched rich meadows intersected by gleaming
brooks, and many-colored flowers peeped out of
the rich verdure.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_38">38</div>
<p>Hermes paused to admire the lovely spot, then
entered the grotto to seek Ulysses. The poor fellow
who could find no peace of mind in this beautiful
isle, and who was vexed by the advances of the
goddess, used to go down every day and seat himself
beside the surf to gaze out over the dark waters
in the direction in which his beloved fatherland lay.
The nymph, however, sat at her loom weaving herself
a garment with a golden shuttle and singing
gayly at her work. She recognized Hermes at
once and was surprised to see him. He delivered
to her the strict command of Jupiter to release
Ulysses, as the gods had determined upon his
return. This frightened the goddess, and she began
to complain of the jealousy and cruelty of the gods.
She promised to obey, however, through fear of
the anger and vengeance of Jupiter.</p>
<p>In the meanwhile Hermes had been hospitably
entertained, for even the gods regale one another,
though they do not eat mortal food. Their food is
called ambrosia and they drink a divine liquid which
the poets call nectar. After feasting, Hermes
repeated the message and left the island.</p>
<p>When Calypso had spent her grief in a flood of
tears she went out to seek Ulysses. She found him
sitting pensively on the shore. &ldquo;My dear friend,&rdquo;
she said, &ldquo;thou must not pass thy life here in melancholy
and grieving. I will have compassion on
thee and let thee go. But thou must build a craft
for thyself. Go to the forest, select trees, cut and
trim them with the axe which I shall give thee, and
fashion for thyself a strong raft. I can give thee
no rowers, but I will plentifully provide thee with
food, drink, and clothes, and will give thee a gentle
wind to bear thee out into the sea. If the gods
are willing thou shalt soon reach thy dear native
land in safety.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_39">39</div>
<p>Ulysses sprang up. Her words gave him a thrill
of joyful surprise. He could scarcely believe his
good fortune. &ldquo;Swear to me,&rdquo; he cried hastily,
&ldquo;that thou speakest the truth and art not contriving
fresh affliction for me!&rdquo; The goddess smiled,
and to please him swore the most terrible oath of
the gods, by the earth, the heavens, and the river
Styx, and now at last the hero believed her.</p>
<p>The following morning he hastened into the
forest, and after four days of incessant labor his
raft was finished and furnished with mast, rudder,
and yard-arms. Calypso supplied the sail and filled
the raft with skins and baskets of sweet water, wine,
and delicious food, and on the fifth day she accompanied
him to the beach and he joyfully embarked.
A gentle breeze filled his sail and he steered boldly
across the boundless waters, guided by the sun by
day and the stars by night. He journeyed swiftly
for seventeen days, happy in the thought that he
was approaching nearer to his beloved wife and
native land. But lo, on the eighteenth day, when in
sight of the island of Corfu, Poseidon caught sight
of the bold man and his anger blazed up anew.
&ldquo;Aha!&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;the gods have doubtless taken
him under their protection while I have been away,
but in spite of this he shall suffer disaster and
sorrow enough before he reach the land which is
appointed for his refuge.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_40">40</div>
<p>The angry words had scarcely been spoken before
dark clouds began to gather at his bidding. He
dipped his trident into the sea and it was disturbed
to its depths. Then he called upon the winds to
come out of their caves and strive together, and
dark night descended upon the waters. Ulysses
trembled. He was alone upon the broad ocean.
Land had disappeared, and as far as the eye could
see there were only the dark waves which rose in
their might, then dashed upon him, carrying him
first heavenwards, then down into the depths of
an abyss. Clinging desperately to his raft, he was
tossed to and fro. A terrific blast swept away
mast and sail and then came a great wave, like a
mountain, which broke over the raft and submerged
it. Ulysses lost his hold, but when he arose he saw
it floating near him and managed to climb upon it,
thus escaping certain death. But the storm still
raged and there seemed no hope of rescue.</p>
<p>However, he was destined to be saved. Leucothea,
the sea goddess, discovered him in the midst
of the angry waves and took pity on him. She
swung herself up out of the sea on to the raft and
seated herself. &ldquo;Poor man,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;thou must
surely have sorely offended Poseidon, but he shall
not destroy thee. Thou shalt be cast on the shores
of Scheria. Take this girdle and tie it about thee;
then cast off thy heavy garments, leave thy float,
and save thyself by swimming. The girdle will
bear thee safely to the shore, but when thou art
once there, do not fail to throw it behind thee into
the sea.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_41">41</div>
<p>With these words she disappeared in the waters.
Ulysses was still in doubt, for he feared the vision
was a malicious deception of Poseidon&rsquo;s. He would
not leave the raft so long as it held together, but he
kept the girdle to try its power in case of need.</p>
<p>He did not have long to wait, for a sudden shower
of water dashed the raft in pieces. The logs separated
and the poor sailor fell between them into
the sea. It was now life or death. He swam toward
the largest piece of the raft, caught hold of it, and
swung himself astride the log like a horseman,
holding fast by his knees. Riding thus, he drew off
his heavy tunic and threw it into the sea, tied on the
girdle, and sprang confidently into the water to
try his luck. As he was struggling in the water
Poseidon saw him and said: &ldquo;This time thou mayst
escape death, but I hope that thou wilt not soon
forget the horrors of this day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Poseidon departed and by degrees the wild waves
subsided. The terrible storm had lasted two days
and two nights, and in all this time poor Ulysses
had had nothing to eat or drink. He kept on swimming,
sustained by the divine girdle. He was
again filled with hope and joy when he saw the waves
subsiding and the rocky coast of Scheria (or Corfu)
close before him. But he was not yet safe, for the
surf kept dashing him back from the steep walls of
rock. This was worse than his battle with the
waves; and with torn hands he was obliged to swim
nearly around the island before he could find a
landing place.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_42">42</div>
<p>At length he came to a spot where a little island
stream flowed into the sea. The beach was low
and it was protected from the winds. Ulysses
took courage, and praying to the divinity of the
stream he said: &ldquo;Hear me, oh ruler, whoever thou
art, and take pity on me! Thou seest I have escaped
Poseidon&rsquo;s wrath, and now I put myself under
thy protection.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The river god heard him, and Ulysses soon sank
upon his knees on the green grass and kissed the
blessed earth. But now his strength was spent and
he sank into a state of deep unconsciousness. Voice
and breath left him; he was utterly exhausted.</p>
<p>As soon as he recovered himself he gratefully
remembered Leucothea and her command. He
arose, unbound the wet girdle, and with averted
face cast it into the sea. Then fearfully and timidly
he began to explore the island. Night was
approaching and no one was to be seen. Naked as
he was, where should he find shelter? It was damp
and cold on the beach, and in the wood which he
saw before him there might be savage animals.
Still he walked on toward it and discovered a few
wild olive trees whose thick boughs made a welcome
shelter against sun, rain, and wind. On the
ground lay a great mass of dry leaves which he
heaped together and then crept under, his body
hidden by the foliage. A deep sleep fell upon him
in his bed of leaves, and for a time his hardships
were forgotten.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_43">43</div>
<h2 id="c4"><span class="h2line1">Chapter IV</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">Nausicaa</span></h2>
<p>Scheria was inhabited by a peaceful people,
who cared more for commerce and navigation
than for agriculture and the chase.
They had built a town near the harbor, and had
dockyards where busy workmen were to be seen
building ships. Order, morality, and prosperity
reigned and the people were ruled by gentle King
Alcinous who had a magnificent palace in the city,
where the nobles gathered daily to offer sacrifice
and to feast with their king.</p>
<p>While the weary Ulysses was sleeping his friend
Athene was planning a means of making him acquainted
with the foremost people of the island.
The king had a young and pretty daughter named
Nausicaa, who was dreaming sweetly one morning
when Athene appeared in her dreams in the form of
one of her youthful companions and began to scold
her. &ldquo;Lazy girl! when wilt thou think of washing
the fine garments which are lying soiled about
the house? Thou wilt soon be a bride, and what if
thy garments are not in order? Arise quickly!
Let thy father provide thee with a cart and donkeys
to take us to the washing place. I will go with thee,
and we will take our maidens and wash and dry
so that father and mother shall be delighted with
our industry.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_44">44</div>
<p>Nausicaa, upon awaking, determined to obey
the admonition. She begged her father for the
cart and, when it was ready, filled it with the soiled
garments. Her mother provided victuals and a
skin of wine, and when all was ready the pretty
washer maiden seated herself on the cart, took up
the reins and whip, and drove out of the city, followed
by her companions. The washing place was
beside a clear stream whose waters filled little canals
and basins which had been excavated for the purpose.
The clothes were thrown into one of these
basins, the maidens undressed and sprang into the
water, where they trod the garments with their
feet. After being thus cleansed the clothes were
spread out to dry on a beach of clean pebbles by
the side of the stream.</p>
<p>The maidens then bathed, anointed themselves
with oil, and opened the baskets and wine skin to
enjoy an out-of-door breakfast. Next they seated
themselves in a circle. Nausicaa began to sing and
the maidens to dance and amuse themselves playing
ball. When they had had enough of the games
they gathered up the garments, folded them neatly,
and packed them away in the cart, harnessed the
donkeys, and made ready to depart. Before she
mounted, the sportive Nausicaa threw the ball
once more toward one of her companions. But it
fell into the river far away, making the frolicsome
girls clap their hands and shriek with laughter,
which awoke the echoes along the shore. And
behold Athene had so arranged that these gay
sounds should awaken the snoring Ulysses. He
raised himself, listening, rubbing his eyes and brushing
the leaves from his hair and beard.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_45">45</div>
<p>&ldquo;Those are human voices,&rdquo; he thought; &ldquo;but
alas, what kind of people may they be? Perchance
rough barbarians who will not understand my language
and know nothing of the gods or of hospitality.
But stay&mdash;are they not the voices of laughing
maidens? I will come out and take a look at them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He crawled out of the thicket, shook off the dry
leaves, and as he was stark naked, broke off a thick
bough with which to cover himself. Thus he appeared
like some wild forest monster. The maidens,
who saw him coming from a distance, were afraid,
cried out, and ran away. But Nausicaa was an
intrepid girl, and Athene secretly encouraged her.
She stood still and quietly waited for the man to
approach.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_46">46</div>
<p>He came nearer, but did not presume to embrace
her knees after the manner of a petitioner, but made
plea at a respectful distance. &ldquo;Humbly I approach
thee, goddess or virgin, for I know not who thou
art,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Thy stature and thy splendid
form tell me that if a goddess thou must be Artemis.
Art thou a mortal maiden, then are thy parents and
thy brethren fortunate; for truly their hearts must
leap within them to see thee in the dance. But
happier than all others I count the man from whose
hands thy father shall accept the suitor&rsquo;s gifts and
who shall take thee to his house, a bride. Truly
I have never seen a human creature so like a slender
palm tree. Yesterday I was cast by the sea upon
this coast. I know it not, and no one here knows
me. I do not presume, noble maiden, to embrace
thy knees, but I beg thee have compassion on me;
for after unspeakable trials thou art the first person
whom I have met. Show me the city where
the men of this land live, and give me some rags to
cover myself. May the gods reward thee a thousand
times. May they give thee all that thy heart
desires, a husband, a house, and blessed harmony
of life. For certainly nothing is so desirable as
that husband and wife shall live in peace and united
in tender love.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This speech pleased pretty Nausicaa and she
pitied the stranger. She told him her name and
all about her father and mother and promised him
hospitality. Then she recalled her maidens, commanded
them to conduct the guest to the bath and
to refresh him with food and drink. But the man
was too fearsome a sight. One pushed forward
the other until they at last plucked up heart and
led Ulysses to the river. Nausicaa sent him some
of the freshly washed clothes and the remains of
their oil. The maidens placed all these things
beside the stream and withdrew while Ulysses made
his toilet.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_47">47</div>
<p>The bath was very necessary, for he was covered
with mud from head to foot, but after it he was
like one new born. Graced with the new garments
he appeared in renewed youth amongst the maidens,
who were astonished at his glowing countenance.
He seemed to have grown taller and handsomer.
His matted hair now fell in shining ringlets over his
forehead and neck, and his whole appearance gave
such an impression of nobility and charm that
Nausicaa could not help a secret wish that he might
remain in Scheria and take her to wife.</p>
<p>The maidens placed before him what was left of
the food and wine, and truly the poor man had
fasted long enough. When he had eaten the company
prepared to return. Nausicaa mounted her
cart, and the maidens followed her on foot. As long
as the road led through the fields Ulysses accompanied
them, but when they neared the city Nausicaa
bade him wait in a poplar grove until she should
reach home; then he was to follow and appear at
her father&rsquo;s house.</p>
<p>Thus she wished to avoid gossip so that no one
might say: &ldquo;Ah, see what a stately stranger Nausicaa
has picked out for herself. She wishes him
for her husband. She can really not wait until
she is wooed. Of course it is better to choose a
stranger, for the noble youths among our own people
are certainly not good enough for her.&rdquo; &ldquo;No, stranger,
not thus shall they speak,&rdquo; she added, blushing.
&ldquo;I have myself often found fault with girls who have
been seen with a man without the knowledge of their
parents and before the nuptials were celebrated.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_48">48</div>
<p>Nausicaa gave Ulysses one more direction. When
he entered the royal hall he was first to embrace
the knees of the queen and to make his plea for protection
to her. If she favored him then he might
hope to see his home again. Not until then was he
to approach the king.</p>
<p>Ulysses carefully noted all these directions and
remained in the grove until he was sure the maidens
had arrived at their destination. Meanwhile he
prayed to his protector, Athene, that she might
grant that he find pity and favor with the men of
this unknown people.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_49">49</div>
<h2 id="c5"><span class="h2line1">Chapter V</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">Ulysses visits the King of the Ph&aelig;acians</span></h2>
<p>The sun had set and darkness had fallen
when the hero set out for the city of the
Ph&aelig;acians. As soon as he came near the
first houses, his friend Athene met him disguised as
a young girl returning with a pitcher of water from
the well.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Daughter, canst thou show me the way to the
palace of Alcinous, thy king?&rdquo; Ulysses addressed
her. &ldquo;I am come from a distant country and am a
stranger here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very willingly, good father, will I show thee
the house,&rdquo; answered the friendly girl. &ldquo;The king
lives very near my father. Come with me and I
will guide thee that thou needst not inquire of another.
People are not overfriendly to strangers
here.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_50">50</div>
<p>Ulysses thanked the maiden and followed her
unseen by anyone. He was astonished at the great
market place and harbor, the large ships and high
walls. When they had been walking for a while
the girl stopped and said: &ldquo;See, good father, here is
the king&rsquo;s house. Thou wilt find the princes at
their meal. Walk boldly in and fear nothing, for
a bold front is always successful. But I must tell
thee one thing more. When thou enterest thou
shalt go straight to the queen, Arete. She is very
wise and is honored far and wide above all women.
The king also reverences her and she rules everything,
judging even the men&rsquo;s quarrels with wisdom.
She is greeted everywhere by old and young
like a goddess. If she is gracious to thee, then
mayest thou hope to return to thy native land.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With these words Athene left him, and Ulysses
went into the courtyard of the castle and paused in
amazement on the threshold of the house. Everything
that he saw was very beautiful. The walls
looked like bronze, the doorway like silver, and the
ring on the gate was of gold. At the back of the
open hall were rows of seats disposed against the
walls, on which sat the nobles at the banquet. Beside
them stood beautifully clothed youths holding
torches to light the feast. Fifty maidens served in
the palace, some of them grinding grain on the
handmills, others embroidering or spinning; for the
women of the Ph&aelig;acians were as famous for their
wonderful weaving as the men were as navigators.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_51">51</div>
<p>When the hero entered the king&rsquo;s hall it was
already late and the company was about to break
up. The guests were standing with their goblets
in their hands ready to drink a last offering to Hermes.
Just then they saw a stranger cross the hall
and kneel before the queen. All listened attentively
to what he was about to say. He clasped
Arete&rsquo;s knees, as was the custom of supplicants,
and spoke: &ldquo;O Arete, daughter of the immortal
hero Rhexenor, I embrace thy knees and the king&rsquo;s,
thy husband&rsquo;s, and all the guests. I am a man
overwhelmed with misfortune. May the gods prosper
thee and give thee long life and to thy children
great honor and wealth! Only help me to return to
my home, for it is many years since I have seen my
people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With these words he arose and seated himself in
the ashes beside the hearth, as was customary for
one asking help. At first the spectators were
dumb with surprise, but in a few moments an old
man broke the silence. &ldquo;Alcinous,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;thou
must not allow a stranger to sit amongst the ashes.
Come, lead him to a couch and let the heralds mix
wine for him as an offering to Jupiter, and let the
servants bring the stranger food.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The king immediately arose, took Ulysses by the
hand, and led him to a seat beside his own. What
a contrast to the previous evening when the poor
man, deprived of his clothes, dripping and exhausted
by his struggle with the waves, had staggered on
land and raked together a bed of leaves in which
to warm himself. Now he was luxuriously feasting,
by torchlight, in a magnificent hall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come,&rdquo; cried the king to the herald, &ldquo;mix another
bowl of wine and fill the cups of the guests
that we may drink once more to Jupiter, the protector
of those seeking aid.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_52">52</div>
<p>The herald did the king&rsquo;s bidding and all poured
the libation to Jupiter on the ground, then drank
off the remainder, and arose from their seats. The
king commanded them to come again the following
day to discuss how they might assist the stranger
to return to his home, unless&mdash;this had just occurred
to him&mdash;he might be a god in disguise who
took pleasure in mingling with mortals.</p>
<p>Ulysses modestly denied this flattering suggestion.
&ldquo;No, indeed,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I am the most miserable
and unfortunate of men. But now let me
eat a little more, for unhappy as I am, hunger is
stronger than my sorrows, and an empty stomach
gives a mortal no peace. But to-morrow, noble
lords, ye shall do to me even as the king hath said
and send me home, since for many years I have
been consumed with longing for my wife and home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The princes listened to the stranger with respect,
for his speech and noble mien betrayed the man
of intellect and ability. When the guests had
gone, Ulysses was left alone with the king and queen.
Servants removed the remains of the feast, and now
the queen, who had remained silent before the men,
began to question her guest. She had been watching
him, half in admiration and half with distrust,
for she recognized the garments which he wore,
having woven them herself. &ldquo;I must ask thee,&rdquo;
said she, &ldquo;who thou art and whence thou comest.
Who gave thee these garments? Thou sayest
that thou comest to us from across the sea.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_53">53</div>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, Queen,&rdquo; answered Ulysses, &ldquo;it is too long a
story to tell thee all my history. Far out in the sea
lies the isle Ogygia, where lives the beautiful and
powerful goddess Calypso. A frightful storm which
destroyed my ship cast me on that shore, and for
seven years the lovely goddess held me captive
there. She promised me immortal youth if I would
abide with her and be her husband, but she could
not persuade me. At last she changed her mind
and only twenty days ago released me, gave me rich
gifts and a successful voyage until I came in sight
of the blue hills of this isle. Then Poseidon&rsquo;s wrath
overtook me, and a terrible storm broke up my ship.
Naked, I managed by constant swimming to reach
these shores. Last night I passed miserably in a
thicket, but a sweet sleep held me fast bound for
nearly twenty hours. I did not awaken until
afternoon; then I heard voices, and saw thy daughter
and her maidens not far away. I approached her
in my distress, and behold, I found a sensible and
noble-minded maiden. She refreshed me with food
and wine, bathed and anointed me, and gave me
these garments; then bade me come hither.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All that is very good,&rdquo; said Alcinous, &ldquo;but the
naughty girl has neglected a part of her duty. She
should have brought thee straight to us, and she
was here long before thou camest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She did indeed offer to conduct me hither,&rdquo; said
the hero, &ldquo;but I did not consider it fitting and did
not wish thee to misjudge me. Therefore I remained
modestly behind, for we men are very suspicious
creatures.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_54">54</div>
<p>&ldquo;I am not so hasty in my judgments,&rdquo; interrupted
Alcinous. &ldquo;However, all things should be
done in order, and I perceive that thou art an excellent
man. If such a one as thou should request my
daughter&rsquo;s hand, I would gladly take him for a son-in-law.
If thou wilt remain here I will give thee
houses and lands, but Jupiter would not wish that
I should force thee to stay with us. No, if thou so
desirest I will despatch thee to-morrow on thy way.
Our rowers shall take thee safely back to thy home,
however far away it may be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O Father Jupiter,&rdquo; cried Ulysses at these words,
&ldquo;let all come to pass as this noble man hath said.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And now the queen commanded the maids to prepare
a bed with soft cushions and fine covers for the
stranger in the hall. They went out with torches,
and when all was in readiness called the stranger
to his well-earned rest.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_55">55</div>
<h2 id="c6"><span class="h2line1">Chapter VI</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">Ulysses among the Ph&aelig;acians</span></h2>
<p>At daybreak King Alcinous and his guest
arose. They went to the market place
and seated themselves upon two hewn
stones, such as were ranged about for the princes
when they were gathered together for conference.
No one had yet arrived, but Athene, disguised as a
herald, was already going from house to house inviting
the chiefs to a counsel. They appeared in groups
and occupied the seats, while the populace crowded
about to catch a glimpse of the stranger. He stood
among them like a god, for Athene had made him
seem taller and his glances fierier, that he might
awaken admiration and love in the Ph&aelig;acians.
When they had all come together the king began to
speak.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_56">56</div>
<p>&ldquo;Hear me,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;ye noble lords of Ph&aelig;acia!
This stranger here&mdash;I know not whether he comes to
us from the east or from the west&mdash;implores us to
speed him on his way. Let us quickly settle the
matter, for never has anyone come to me with a
plea which has not been granted. Then arise,
youths, and assemble twenty-two of your number,
launch a stanch ship, and provide all that is necessary
for the voyage. Then come to my palace and
I will set food and drink before you. And ye,
princes, grant me another favor. Follow me to my
stately hall that we may once more entertain
the stranger worthily. And that song may not
be lacking for our friend, call the divine singer
Demodocus.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The company separated to carry out the king&rsquo;s
commands, and when all was ready they repaired
to the palace, which was filled with guests. Alcinous
caused twelve sheep, eight swine, and two oxen
to be brought from his stables, which the youths
began to prepare, while the herald returned with
the minstrel who was to entertain the guests.</p>
<p>He was blind, but his mind was stored with splendid
tales which he could recite most eloquently,
accompanying himself upon the harp. The herald
led him gently by the arm into the midst of the company,
where he placed a chair for him near a pillar.
He then hung the harp upon a nail and guided the
blind man&rsquo;s hand to the place. Next he placed a
table before him with meat, brought the bread
basket, mixed the wine for him, and waited
upon the other guests likewise. As soon as the
company had satisfied their appetites, the minstrel
took down his harp and began to prelude; then his
song rang out like unto distant cries of battle and
clang of swords and thundering of hoofs. He sang
of the heroic deeds of the Trojan war, and the song
found an echo deep in the hearts of his Greek hearers.
Then the lines changed, and he celebrated the prowess
of two heroes whose fame outshone all others&mdash;Achilles
and Ulysses.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_57">57</div>
<p>It was like a sword-thrust to our hero. His
heart was torn with memories. He pulled his mantle
over his head and hid his face, that the Ph&aelig;acians
might not see his tears. Alcinous, who sat beside
him, heard his sobs and at the minstrel&rsquo;s next pause
tactfully said: &ldquo;Friends, I think we have had enough
of feasting and song. Let us go forth and practise
some games, that our guest may see and admire
the skill of our people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The company at once arose and followed the king,
the blind minstrel being guided by a faithful servant.
The market place was full of life. The nobles seated
themselves, the people stood round about, and the
youths who were to show their skill in wrestling, boxing,
running, and throwing entered the great arena.</p>
<p>First there was a race between three sons of the
king, Laodamas, Halius, and Clyton&aelig;us, which was
won by the latter. Then came the wrestlers, the
strongest of whom was Euryalus. Next came jumping,
then disk throwing, and at last boxing. In this
dangerous sport the handsome Laodamas was the
victor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen, friends,&rdquo; cried the bold young man;
&ldquo;let us inquire if our guest be not skilled in games.
Truly he has a noble figure. See his powerful chest,
his thighs, his arms, and his strong neck. His build
proclaims the man of skill, and he is in the prime of
his powers.&rdquo; &ldquo;It is a good idea! Go and challenge
him,&rdquo; answered Euryalus, the wrestler.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_58">58</div>
<p>Laodamas followed the behest, but Ulysses declined.
&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;my misfortunes are nearer
to my heart than feats of strength, and my only
thought is of how I may quickly reach home. Ye
do not know all that I have suffered.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very good, my friend,&rdquo; mocked the hasty Euryalus;
&ldquo;one can see that thou art not an expert. No
warrior art thou, but perchance an agent on a merchant
vessel, who ships the goods and reckons up the
profits.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was an unseemly speech,&rdquo; answered the
noble Ulysses. &ldquo;Truly the gods have distributed
their gifts in various ways. Many a man of insignificant
stature is distinguished for his intellect,
while perhaps another with a godlike form is poor in
good sense. Thus it is with thee. Thou art beautiful
to look upon, but hast little wit. Truly, wert
thou not so young a fool, thou hadst angered me
with thine impertinent speech. No, believe me, I
am no novice at boxing. I have measured myself
with the bravest before calamity bowed me down;
for I have suffered all that a man can, on the field of
battle as well as in storms at sea. But even so, I
will not leave thy challenge unanswered. Give me
the disk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He took the heaviest of the metal plates, swung
it by the strap a few times&mdash;in a circle, and then cast
it high in the air, so that it fell far beyond the marks
of the other throwers. One of the spectators ran
forward and put a stake in the place where the disk
lay, and when he returned he cried aloud: &ldquo;Hail
to thee, stranger. In this contest thou mayest be
sure none shall equal thee.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_59">59</div>
<p>&ldquo;See if ye can throw as far, ye youths,&rdquo; cried
Ulysses. &ldquo;And if anyone is anxious to contend
with me, either in boxing, wrestling, or in running,
let him come. Ph&aelig;acians, I am ready! Come who
will, excepting Laodamas. He is my host, and it
were unseemly to challenge him who hath fed and
sheltered me. But I will not refuse any of the others,
and truly I need not fear. I am expert in all feats
of strength, but in spanning the bow I still have to
find my master. Amongst a crowd of the enemy
I can single out my man, and my arrow will lay him
low. But one man excelled me when we lay before
Troy, Philoctetes; but amongst all the rest I was
the foremost. With the lance I aimed better than
another with the arrow. In running, one of you
could perhaps outdo me; for the stormy sea and
long fasts have much weakened me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Ph&aelig;acians all were silent. Not one dared
challenge the hero. Then the king began to speak.
&ldquo;Worthy stranger, we believe thy words, for thou
dost not speak through love of boasting, but because
the youth has bitterly offended thee. Listen to
me, that thou mayest yet speak well of us at home.
In boxing and wrestling we do not excel, but Jupiter
has granted us to be fleet in the race above all
peoples and masters upon the sea. We also love
much feasting, harping, and the dance, beautiful
garments and warm baths. Come then, ye who are
skilled in the dance, show yourselves, that the
stranger may tell of your art. Let some one fetch
Demodocus&rsquo; harp.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_60">60</div>
<p>The young dancers took their places and began
the dance with measured steps and wondrous leapings,
while Ulysses admired their flying feet. The
strains of the harp formed a lovely accompaniment
to the movements of the dancers, and the old minstrel
soon struck up a comic song which compelled
the listeners to break into shouts of laughter. When
the choral dance had lasted a while, Laodamas and
Halius danced alone, to the admiration of all. One
threw a ball almost to the clouds, and the other,
leaping, caught it ere his foot had touched the earth.
Ulysses was delighted with the agility and grace of
the youths and paid them compliments which
delighted their father&rsquo;s heart. And as he had determined
to dismiss the stranger royally, he proposed
to the assembly that each of the twelve chiefs of
the Ph&aelig;acians should make the guest a present of
gold, together with a fine embroidered robe. The
impertinent Euryalus was obliged to beg the guest&rsquo;s
pardon and to offer him a propitiatory gift.</p>
<p>All agreed to the king&rsquo;s proposal, and the youth
brought a brazen sword with a silver hilt and scabbard
of ivory as his offering. He approached
Ulysses abashed, and with eyes cast down addressed
him. &ldquo;Be not angry, oh stranger. Let the winds
scatter the offensive words which I have spoken.
May the gods grant thee a speedy return to thy house
and thy people, after thy long wanderings.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_61">61</div>
<p>&ldquo;My dear fellow,&rdquo; answered Ulysses, &ldquo;mayest
thou also enjoy the favor of the gods. And mayest
thou never regret the gift which thou hast offered
me.&rdquo; He hung the sword over his shoulder, and all
irritation was forgotten.</p>
<p>In the meanwhile evening had descended. Servants
brought the gifts to the market place, and they
were carried into the palace. There also the princes
gathered, taking their usual places in the hall.
Alcinous requested the queen to have a warm bath
prepared for their guest, while he selected the gifts
which he intended to present to him.</p>
<p>A great kettle of water was brought, the maids
piled up wood and kindled a fire under it, while
the queen herself brought in the costly presents and
packed them deftly away in a chest, which Ulysses
bound and tied with a cunning knot taught him
by the powerful Circe. He then went out to the
bath, luxuriating in the steaming tub. When he
had dried himself, the maids anointed him with oil,
and draped him with a magnificent tunic and cloak.
Just as he was about to re&euml;nter the festal hall he
felt soft hands upon his arm. It was the lovely
Nausicaa, whom he had not seen since the previous
day. She had learned of the preparations for his
departure, and her heart desired to look once more
upon the splendid man who had approached her
with such dignity the day before. So she stole
down the stairs and awaited him at the door. He
came, a noble virility shining from his countenance,
his bearing breathing dignity and power.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_62">62</div>
<p>&ldquo;Hail to thee, oh guest,&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;When
thou art again in thine home, think sometimes of
the girl in Scheria to whom thou once didst owe
thy life.&rdquo; She looked down and could scarcely keep
back the tears.</p>
<p>The stranger answered: &ldquo;If the gods will but grant
me a safe return I shall remember thee and praise
thy name like a goddess&rsquo; each day, for thou hast
saved my life, gentle maiden.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nausicaa went sorrowfully back to her chamber,
while Ulysses entered the hall and took his seat.
The servants brought roasted meat and began to fill
the goblets of the guests from great pitchers of milk.
A herald guided the venerable minstrel to his place.
Ulysses beckoned to the herald, then cut a fat morsel
from the piece of meat before him, saying: &ldquo;Take
this to Demodocus. Poor though I am, I should
like to do him honor, for one should always respect
the minstrels. The muse herself has taught them
and showers her favors upon them.&rdquo; Demodocus
accepted the gift with pleasure.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_63">63</div>
<p>When all had appeased their hunger, Ulysses
turned again to the minstrel and begged him, as
he knew all the adventures of the Trojan war, to
sing the one of the wooden horse with which Ulysses
had deceived the Trojans. So the man sang the
curious tale, never dreaming that the hero whose
cunning he was celebrating was at his side. During
the recital the hero often sighed and wiped away
a tear. Alcinous noticed his emotion and again
tactfully bade the singer pause, saying: &ldquo;Our guest
has been listening in tears; a deep sorrow seems to
gnaw at his heart. Let the singer be silent, then,
that all may be joyful. The stranger who cometh
to us with confidence must be dear to us as a brother.
And now tell us, friend, without evasion, what we
would know of thee. Speak! What is thy name,
who are thy parents, and where thy native land?
For this we must know, if we would guide thee thither,
which we shall gladly do, although an ancient oracle
has warned us that jealous Poseidon will sometime
sink our ship on its return from such a voyage.
Tell us, too, where thou hast been and of the people
thou hast met. Tell us all this and also why thou
weepest while the minstrel sings of Troy.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_64">64</div>
<h2 id="c7"><span class="h2line1">Chapter VII</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">Ulysses tells his Story&mdash;The Lotus-Eaters, Polyphemus, Circe, Scylla, and Charybdis&mdash;The Visit to Hades</span></h2>
<p>The company sat in silent expectation, gazing
intently at the stranger, who began as
follows: &ldquo;The land of the Ph&aelig;acians is
indeed a delightful land, and I know no greater
pleasure than to sit in the banquet hall, while heralds
move from table to table filling the cups, and
the minstrel sings splendid songs of the heroic deeds
of brave men. For harp and voice are the ornaments
of the feast. But ye ask me for my unhappy
history. Where shall I begin the tale, for the immortal
gods have heaped much misery upon me?
Let my name come first, that ye may know me and
keep me in remembrance. I am Ulysses, son of
Laertes, well known to men through many exploits.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Ph&aelig;acians were transfixed with astonishment,
and the old minstrel bemoaned the loss of
his eyesight that he was unable to see the man whose
heroic deeds he had so often sung. He, the most
famous among all the Trojan warriors, had eaten
and drunk with them, and was now going to tell
them of all the wonderful deeds which he had done
and the hardships he had suffered.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_65">65</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I am Ulysses,&rdquo; continued the hero. &ldquo;The
sunny isle of Ithaca is my home. I will not speak of
the unhappy war. When it was ended I turned with
my comrades to Ismarus, the city of the Ciconians,
destroyed it, slew the fleeing men, while we divided
the women and other booty amongst us. I now
counselled that we should hasten from the place,
but my foolish comrades did not obey me. As
long as they had enough plunder, wine, sheep, and
goats, they caroused upon the shore and thus brought
the first misfortune upon us.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The conquered Ciconians summoned their allies
in the interior, who responded in great numbers,
fell upon us, and horribly revenged themselves.
The fierce battle at the ships began early in the morning.
At first we defied the overwhelming numbers
of the enemy, but as the sun set we were obliged to
give way. Each of my ships lost six men, and it was
only with difficulty that I escaped in swift boats
with the others. Happy in our escape we sailed
toward the west, keeping near to the coast of Greece.
Then a terrible storm arose, breaking the masts
and tearing the sails. With difficulty we put to
shore to mend them, and on the third morning
when we set out with renewed hope, a fresh storm
descended upon us from the heights of Malea and
drove us far out into the open sea.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_66">66</div>
<p>&ldquo;For nine days we drifted before the awful north
wind, and on the tenth day were driven on the coast
of the lotus-eaters. They are an amiable people
and most fortunate, for they possess a fruit called
the lotus, which is their daily food and is sweeter
than honey. Whoever eats of it forgets his home
and desires to remain there forever. We landed to
take on fresh water and the lotus did not fail in its
effects. I had to drive my companions back to the
ships, bind them with ropes, and throw them under
the rowers&rsquo; benches, and if I had not put off again
quickly, not a single man would have followed me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We now rowed out again over the boundless
sea and landed on a wooded island near the coast
of Sicily, which was uninhabited except by countless
herds of goats roaming the lowlands. They were
without fear, so that we had easy hunting, and provided
ourselves plentifully with game. When we
had refreshed ourselves with food and sleep I was
anxious to row across to the next island, which
seemed to be very large and fruitful. We could hear
voices there and see cattle climbing about the hills.
It is the home of the giant race of Cyclops, a savage
people who know nothing of agriculture, have no
laws, nor fear gods nor men. I said to my companions:
&lsquo;Remain here with your ships. I will row
across in mine with twelve picked companions and
examine the land.&rsquo; I embarked, taking with me a
large skin of excellent wine, for I divined that I
might fall in with savage people who could not be
won by reason or fair words, and therefore I
furnished myself with this sweet, beguiling drink.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_67">67</div>
<p>&ldquo;On our arrival I carefully concealed my vessel
in a hidden cave and landed with my people and
my wine skin. Not far away I saw a tremendous
cave in the rock surrounded by a wall of great
stones and shaded by a row of gigantic firs and oaks.
It was the dwelling of the most terrible of the
giants, where he spent the night with his goats and
sheep; for the care of his flocks was his sole occupation.
He was the son of Poseidon and his name was
Polyphemus. Like all the Cyclops, he had a single
but horrible eye in the middle of his forehead. His
arms were powerful enough to move rocks, and he
could sling granite blocks through the air like pebbles.
He wandered about alone among the mountains,
none of the other Cyclops holding intercourse with
him. He was savage and delighted only in mischief
and destructiveness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I, unhappy man, not knowing this, went with
my companions straight to the open cave and entered
it. We did not find him there, as the sun had
not yet gone down and he was still grazing his herds
on distant hills. The stalls were full of lambs and
young kids. There were baskets and tubs of cheese
and milk; also curds in great vessels and milking
pails. My companions wanted very much to fill a
few baskets with cheese, drive away a number of
lambs and kids, and quickly make away with them
in the ships before the dread king of the cave should
return. But I forbade this, for I was too curious
to see the man and hoped, besides, to receive a gift
from him, as is the custom among hospitable people.
But how mistaken I was!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_68">68</div>
<p>&ldquo;We seated ourselves in the cave, lighted a fire for
an offering, and passed the time eating cheese until
the Cyclops should come home. Toward evening he
appeared with his whole herd before the mouth of the
cave. We drew back in affright, and he did not see
us at first. He bore on his shoulders a tremendous
load of wood, which he dropped upon the ground with
a clatter which made the rocks tremble and caused
us to flee into the innermost recesses of the cave.
He then drove the goats and sheep inside, and barred
the entrance with a piece of rock that two and twenty
wagons could not have moved from the spot. We
were prisoners in the power of the monster.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We were able to watch him unobserved for a
while as he seated himself comfortably on the
ground to milk the animals, then poured the milk
into tubs, and last stirred the fire. The flames
leapt up and he discovered us huddled together in
a corner. For a moment he stared, then thundered
at us in a fearful voice: &lsquo;Ho, strangers! Whence
come ye? Are ye traders or robbers who roam the
seas, not sparing human life?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our knees trembled at the sound of the monster&rsquo;s
voice. However, I quickly recovered myself
and answered boldly: &lsquo;We are Greeks returning
from Troy, cast upon this coast by storms. As we
have been overtaken by misfortune we beseech thee
to shelter us and to please the gods by sending us
on our way with gifts. Honor the gods, excellent
sir, for Jupiter is the avenger of all wrongs committed
against the traveller.&rsquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_69">69</div>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Oho! Thou foolish stranger,&rsquo; roared the Cyclops.
&lsquo;Thou seemest to know the Cyclops ill.
Nobody here honors the gods, and we know naught
of thy Jupiter, for we ourselves are much greater.
But tell me, where didst thou land with thy vessel?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I perceived his cunning and determined that he
should not outwit me. &lsquo;My ship,&rsquo; said I aloud.
&lsquo;Ah, had we it still we should not be here. The
waves destroyed it, and had we not been able to
swim, we should all have perished.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Instead of answering, the cruel Cyclops stretched
out both his arms, seized two of my companions,
and dashed them upon the ground so that blood
and brains spattered in all directions. He tore
them apart and ate them. We shrieked aloud when
we saw this horrid deed and prayed to Jupiter.
But our lamentations did not affect the Cyclops.
He drank a tub of milk and stretched himself out
to sleep.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;What shall I do?&rsquo; I said to myself when the
monster began to snore. &lsquo;Shall I plunge my sword
into his heart before he awakens. But no! if I
kill him, who shall open the door for us?&rsquo; No one
but the giant himself would be able to move away
the mighty stone. We should only be preparing
for ourselves a miserable death by slow starvation.
We needed to invent some better plan, and so we
awaited the break of day in fear and uncertainty.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_70">70</div>
<p>&ldquo;With the dawn the Cyclops awoke and went
about his usual business. He put fresh wood on
the fire, milked his herd, and put the nurslings to
suck. Then he again seized two of my dear companions
and killed and ate them as he had done the
others. Next, he pushed back the stone, drove out
the flocks, and deftly rolled the great rock back in
its place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thus we were again imprisoned for the whole
day. I now conceived a plan to avenge our lost
comrades and to free ourselves&mdash;I would put out
his great eye with a red-hot stake! I found just
the piece for the purpose. It was the giant&rsquo;s own
club of green olivewood, as long and as thick as a
mast. I hewed off a piece from the end, my companions
helped to smooth it, and I sharpened the point
and hardened it in the glowing coals. When my
weapon was ready I carefully concealed it under
the pile of straw on the ground. Hereupon we drew
lots to find out which of my companions should
help me thrust the stake into the eye of the sleeping
giant, and we fearfully awaited his return. At
last he came, driving in his flocks, and this time
he left none of the animals outside, either because
he was suspicious of us or because a god had so
decreed. He set up the great stone, milked his
sheep and goats, ate two more of my poor companions,
and put fresh wood on the fire. I now brought
out the wine skin and went boldly up to him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_71">71</div>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;See, Cyclops,&rsquo; said I, filling a jug; &lsquo;here is something
to drink; try it. Wine tastes good after
human flesh. Take it that thou mayest see what
good drink we had upon our lost vessel.&rsquo; He took
the jug and drank. How delighted he was! He
emptied the vessel and said, smiling: &lsquo;Fill again
from thy wine skin and tell me thy name, that I
may make thee a gift. What a delicious draught!
We have wine here, but compared with thine it is
but water. Do but give me more.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I filled his jug three times and he gulped it down
eagerly. I soon saw with delight that his senses
were becoming clouded. Then an excellent idea
occurred to me. &lsquo;Thou wouldst know my name,&rsquo;
said I. &lsquo;My name is Nobody. My father and
mother call me Nobody and so do all people.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Good,&rsquo; said he. &lsquo;Then Nobody shall be the
last one I shall devour. Take that as thy guest
gift from me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With these words he fell upon his back overpowered
by sleep. He tossed about until deep snores
showed that he had at last lost consciousness.
Our time had come! I quickly drew forth the
stake, plunged the end into the fire, turned it about
until it was glowing, and then called upon my companions
to assist me. A god put courage into our
hearts. We all took hold and in an instant had
plunged the fiery pole into the sleeper&rsquo;s great eye.
As when a smith dips glowing iron into cold water,
thus hissed the Cyclops&rsquo; eye as the torch penetrated
it. But we pushed it in the deeper and turned
it round and round until the blood gushed out and
flowed over forehead and cheeks. With a horrible
roar the giant jumped up and we all fled into the
corners of the cave. Bewildered by the pain, he
pulled the glowing brand from his eye and threw it
against the rocky wall, raving like a crazy man.
The other Cyclops were aroused by his desperate
cries and gathered about the cave.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_72">72</div>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;What has happened to thee, Polyphemus,&rsquo;
they cried, &lsquo;to make thee roar thus? Has someone
stolen thy cattle or a murderer attacked thee?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Woe is me!&rsquo; roared the Cyclops. &lsquo;Nobody has
craftily throttled me. Nobody has attacked me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Well, if nobody is attacking thee we are of
no use. We can do naught against inward pains;
for those thou must call on thy father Poseidon.&rsquo;
Speaking thus they went away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How my heart laughed for joy that my false
name had fooled them. But the greatest danger
lay still before us. We might escape the fingers
of the blind giant in the recesses of the cave, but he
now seated himself before the entrance, rolled back
the stone halfway, and stretched out his hands
to catch us should we try to steal out among the
sheep and goats.</p>
<p>&ldquo;However, I conceived a plan to outwit him in
this also. Among the goats were powerful animals,
with very thick wool. I put three of them side by
side and bound them together with withes. The
middle one carried one of my companions under
his body bound securely, while the other two protected
him on either side. A great woolly one,
king of all, I kept back for myself. Thus prepared,
we awaited the morning.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic2">
<img src="images/p3.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="379" />
<p class="caption"><i>THE BLINDING OF POLYPHEMUS</i></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_73">73</div>
<p>&ldquo;At last the flock set out and crowded past their
waiting master, who carefully felt of each woolly
back to see if one of us should not be riding on it.
It never occurred to him that we might be hanging
underneath. At length the first three came up,
carrying their man successfully past, then the second,
and so on. I was last. I crawled underneath,
nestling into the thick wool as deeply as I could
with hands and feet. Then the animal struggled
forward as fast as he was able with his unaccustomed
burden, while I held on desperately by his curly
wool. The Cyclops recognized his favorite at once
in caressing him, and spoke sadly to him. &lsquo;Dear
little one, art thou the last to-day to leave the cave?
Thou, who art always the first to trot so gayly at
the head of all the others. Art perchance sad also,
and dost feel sorry for thy master&rsquo;s eye, which the
villain Nobody has put out? But only wait, he
shall not escape his deserts. If thou couldst but
speak, my little one, thou wouldst tell me at once
where the wretch is hiding. Then shouldst thou
see how his blood and marrow would splash about
the cave. That would be revenge sweet to my
heart.&rsquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_74">74</div>
<p>&ldquo;Thus spake the Cyclops and released the goat.
I let him carry me but a short distance, then let go,
jumped up, and released my companions, of whom,
alas! but six alone were left. Our rescuers we
quietly drove before us, taking them as a thank
offering. The Cyclops carefully closed his door
again and whistled for his flock. We laughed in
our hearts, and slunk quickly away with the stolen
animals to our ship and put off. We rowed as fast
as we could, and when the boat was as far from land
as a man&rsquo;s voice will carry, it occurred to me to
shout a mocking farewell to the monster.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Ho, Cyclops! Take notice that thou hast
entertained no ordinary mortal. In truth thou
hast not eaten my friends for nothing. Thou art
repaid at last for thine inhuman crimes.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How enraged he was. He tore off a piece of
rock and cast it in the direction from which the voice
had come. He aimed well, for it fell into the water
close beside our vessel, so that we rocked in the
trough of the sea. The waves nearly beat us back
to shore again, but I urged on my men and they
regained the high seas.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I could still see the giant feeling of his bloody
forehead, and could not resist calling again, although
my men begged me to desist. &lsquo;Listen once more,
Cyclops. If thou art asked who hath so shamefully
blinded thee, know that it was Ulysses, son of
Laertes!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Cursed guest!&rsquo; sputtered the furious Cyclops.
&lsquo;Thus hath the prophecy been fulfilled! I have
heard thy name and have always feared a great
giant of superhuman powers. And now that it
should be such a midget&mdash;such a tiny weakling
who has outwitted me! Woe is me! But listen,
Ulysses,&rsquo; he called directly afterward; &lsquo;come back
and let us make peace. I will entertain thee royally
and pray Poseidon, my father, that he grant
thee safe conduct. He will certainly restore my
eye; then all shall be forgiven thee.&rsquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_75">75</div>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Ha!&rsquo; I shouted back. &lsquo;Would that I could
but send thee so certainly to Hades that neither
Poseidon nor any god could replace thine eye!&rsquo;
And now I heard him praying loudly to his father
to send misfortunes on my head. Alas, the god
heard him only too well.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the meanwhile we kept on rowing, but were
still in danger, for suddenly another rock came flying
and splashed like the first one into the sea close
to our boat. At last after hard rowing we reached
our little island and divided our booty with our companions.
Our friends had given us up for lost and
had been sitting on the shore day and night, mourning
for us. They gave me the big goat, which had
carried me out of the cave, for my share. I immediately
sacrificed him to Jupiter, and we ate and drank
joyfully together. When the sun sank into the sea
we laid down on the beach to sleep.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When we had recovered from our fright and
had refreshed ourselves with food and drink, we
launched our boats and put out to sea. We travelled
until we reached an island of peculiar formation.
It floated about on the water and was
surrounded by a wall of brass. It was the famous isle
where lives &AElig;olus, the king of the winds. The gods
have given him charge over all the winds, that he
may cause them to blow or to cease at his will.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_76">76</div>
<p>&ldquo;I was hospitably received and delightfully entertained
there for a whole month. In the palace lived
the king&rsquo;s six sons with their beautiful wives. I had
to tell them all about Troy and all that had happened
to me in my unfortunate journey. And when
I begged for safe conduct, &AElig;olus gave me a present
which would have made me supremely happy had
it not been for the foolishness of my companions.
He confined all the winds in a leather bag, binding it
securely with a silver rope. Thus I was fitted out
so that I might make use of the winds should the
vengeful Poseidon again lead me from my course.
I laid the bag in the bottom of the ship without
saying anything to my companions of its contents,
and we sailed away with a gentle wind from &AElig;olus&rsquo;
isle and crossed almost the whole Mediterranean
without accident, sailing nine days and nights,
when suddenly on the tenth evening the shores of
my native island loomed out of the darkness. Yes,
it was really old Ithaca! I saw the watch-fires, the
end of my wanderings had come. And now, weary
as I was, sweet sleep overcame me, for I had labored
at the mast day and night in order to reach home
safely and quickly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;While I slept my companions began to talk of our
return, to recall all that they had undergone, and to
complain that they were returning poor, in spite of
it all. They looked at me enviously, at my rich
booty from Troy, and the number of my guest
gifts. &lsquo;Everywhere that he goes,&rsquo; they said, &lsquo;he
is honored and receives gifts, but we get nothing.
What can he have hidden in that bag? &AElig;olus has
certainly given him a costly present of gold or
silver.&rsquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_77">77</div>
<p>&ldquo;Curiosity incited them to examine the bag, which
the king had bound up so tightly for good reasons.
They had scarcely loosened the cord when a furious
east wind broke loose, which drove us backward in
the direction we had just come. We wretched
ones, who had hoped to land on Ithaca in a few
hours, found ourselves once more on &AElig;olus&rsquo; isle.
We were exhausted on landing, and after taking the
food and drink I set out, with one of my men and the
herald, for &AElig;olus&rsquo; palace. There I found the family
assembled at table, and all were astonished at
my reappearance. I told them my story and begged
for help once more. But the king cried in a terrible
voice: &lsquo;Unhappy one, fly from my house.
Far be it from me to shelter a man who is thus
pursued by the anger of the gods.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorrowfully I rejoined my companions and with
heavy hearts we put out on the treacherous sea.
We rowed continuously for six days, and at last
on the seventh we saw the coast of the L&aelig;strygones.
We found a sheltered harbor where we made fast
our ships. Then I mounted a hill to see if I could
discover traces of people. In the distance I saw
smoke rising and sent two of my men with a herald
to explore the country. They entered a wood
where they found wagon tracks that led to a town,
and there they met a maiden, the buxom daughter
of the king, Antiphates, just going to the well to
draw water. She answered their inquiries by pointing
out her father&rsquo;s lofty dwelling. But when they
entered the great palace they were terrified to
behold the queen, a giantess, tall as a tree, who at
once called her husband, an uncouth barbarian of
gigantic stature. Without a word, like the Cyclops
he seized one of them for his evening meal. The
other two fled in horror to the ships. We saw them
running, and soon a crowd of giants, summoned by
the king&rsquo;s roars, started in pursuit. While we
were trying to loose the ships tremendous stones
began to hurtle through the air upon us, dashing
men and ships in pieces. I had tied my ship behind
a cliff where it was safe from the stones. I quickly
cut the ropes, called to my remaining companions,
and we rowed away as fast as we could. With
horror we saw the L&aelig;strygones spearing our poor
comrades to carry them home to their cruel meal.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_78">78</div>
<p>&ldquo;The current now carried us to the island of
&AElig;&aelig;a. We stole into a sheltering bay and rested
for two days and nights, weak from hunger and
overwork. But on the third day when rosy-fingered
Eos began to paint the sky, I seized lance and sword
and climbed to the top of the rock. The gods took
pity on me and sent a great stag with branching
antlers across my path. Like lightning I planted
my spear in its side, and the animal sank in the dust
with a cry. Bracing my foot against its side I drew
out my spear, bound its feet together, threw the animal
over my shoulder and, staggering under the
unwonted burden, returned with it to the ship.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Come friends,&rsquo; I cried, &lsquo;we shall not descend
to the kingdom of Hades until our day of doom
dawns. As long as there is food and drink let us
be merry and refresh our weary bodies.&rsquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_79">79</div>
<p>&ldquo;The sight of the stately animal put new life
into my fainting comrades. They sprang up, washed
their hands, and began to prepare the meat. We sat
down to an excellent evening repast and our courage
returned. A sweet sleep refreshed us, and at
daybreak we determined to set out and see whom
we could find on the island. But my companions
grew panic-stricken when they thought of the
Cyclops and the cannibal L&aelig;strygones. &lsquo;Very well,&rsquo;
I said, &lsquo;divide yourselves into two parties. I will
lead one and the hero Eurylochus shall lead the
other.&rsquo; We then drew lots from a brass helmet to
see who should explore and who should remain to
guard the ship. The lot fell to the brave Eurylochus
and he hastened to set out with twenty-two
men.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In a distant valley they found the stately palace
of Circe, the Sun-god&rsquo;s daughter, a sorceress
skilled in all the arts. Her dwelling was surrounded
by lions and wolves, which were men transformed
into animals by her magic. They were unfortunates
who had been cast upon her coast by storms. Their
human reason had not been taken from them, so
that they did not attack the approaching men, but
came up to them like friendly dogs. Inside the
palace sat the beautiful Circe at her loom, singing.
&lsquo;Listen,&rsquo; said one of the men, &lsquo;what lovely singing.
Let us go in.&rsquo; The goddess who had overheard
the words, left her work and opened the door.
&lsquo;Come in, strangers,&rsquo; she said sweetly, &lsquo;that I may
entertain ye.&rsquo; The friends obeyed and went inside.
Only the cautious Eurylochus remained without and
hid himself from the sorceress as though he divined
mischief.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_80">80</div>
<p>&ldquo;The strangers were invited to sit on soft cushioned
chairs and Circe passed food and mixed sweet
wine for them, but in the wine she secretly put evil
herbs, and when the poor fellows had drunk of the
mixture Circe touched them all with her magic
wand and in an instant they were changed into grunting
swine. She then drove them out and put them
into pens and laughingly shut them in. Eurylochus,
horrified, saw all this from his hiding place,
then hastened away to bring me the news. In
broken words he related the horrible fate of our
friends.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I immediately sprang up. &lsquo;Guide me thither,&rsquo;
I cried, impatiently. &lsquo;I will avenge the unfortunates
if I cannot save them.&rsquo; But he fell at my feet and
begged me with tears not to sacrifice myself. &lsquo;Let
us flee from the cursed island,&rsquo; he cried, &lsquo;that we,
at least, may escape the same awful fate.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Stay thou,&rsquo; I answered scornfully, &lsquo;and eat and
drink thy fill here by the shore, but I must needs
go.&rsquo; With these words I hurried along the beach
until I saw the dwelling of Circe in the distance.
All at once a shining youth came toward me. I
recognized Hermes by his staff and his glorious
appearance.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_81">81</div>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Friend,&rsquo; said he, taking me by the hand, why
art thou wandering alone among these wild hills?
Dost thou know what awaits thee? Thy friends
are shut up in Circe&rsquo;s pens transformed into swine.
Dost intend to release them? Poor man, thou wilt
scarcely succeed. I fear she will but pen thee up
with the rest.&rsquo; I did not know what to answer,
and could only gaze perplexed at the youthful god.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Listen,&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;I wish thee well and I can
help thee. Therefore let me warn thee to beware
of Circe&rsquo;s tricks. On thy arrival she will mix for
thee a sweet wine with a certain poison which puts
all who partake of it in her power. But here is the
antidote. Pour it secretly into the wine before thou
drinkest, and her herbs cannot harm thee. When
thou hast partaken of the mixture she will touch
thee with her magic wand in the vain endeavor to
transform thee. Take advantage of this moment
to overcome her. Fall upon her with drawn sword
as though thou wouldst pierce her, and thou shalt
see her supplicating for mercy at thy feet. Grant
what she asks, but let her swear a solemn oath that
she will not further harm thee. Then she shall be
appeased, and by degrees, in confidential talk, thou
shalt persuade her to release thy friends also.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The god gave me the wholesome herb, then hastened
back to high Olympus. I gazed gratefully
after him, carefully stowed away his gift, and committed
his advice to memory. Deep in thought I
suddenly found myself at Circe&rsquo;s dwelling and heard
the heavenly singing. I called, and the goddess
immediately appeared. She led me to the silver-mounted
seat and went to prepare the wine in
which she mixed her magic herbs. As soon as she
handed me the cup, I quickly poured Hermes&rsquo;
antidote into it, and drank off the potion without
fear.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_82">82</div>
<p>&ldquo;At once she pointed the magic wand at my head
saying: &lsquo;Now, my little beast, follow thy friends
into the pig-pen.&rsquo; I pushed back my chair, sprang
from behind the table, and fell upon the false one
with drawn sword. She shrieked and threw herself
upon the ground to clasp my knees. &lsquo;Who art
thou and whence comest thou who art the first to
withstand my magic? Never has a mortal resisted
its power. Art thou perhaps the crafty Ulysses
who, Hermes once told me, should visit me on his
long wanderings and set at naught my sorcery?
But look not so fiercely upon me. Put up thy sword.
Sit down peaceably beside me that we may hold
friendly converse.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;O goddess,&rsquo; I answered, &lsquo;how can I trust one
who has robbed me of my friends? I know not what
schemes thou entertainest against me. If I am to
trust thee, swear to me the great oath of the gods
that thou wilt not practise thine arts against me,
sleeping nor waking.&rsquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_83">83</div>
<p>&ldquo;She at once complied and I was reassured. And
now she drew me down upon her couch and fondled
me, while her maidens, beautiful daughters of the
river and forest gods, prepared a delicious repast
for me and one of them heated water for the bath.
When it was ready she washed my head and shoulders
herself and clothed me in rich garments. Then
she led me to a table covered with delicacies. I did
not partake, but leant my head upon my hand and
sank into sorrowful musings. Circe urged me in
vain to eat. &lsquo;O goddess,&rsquo; I sighed, &lsquo;how can I enjoy
a feast in the house where my unhappy companions
are prisoners? Until I see them freed from the
terrible enchantment, thou wilt exert thyself in
vain to cheer me with thy embraces and thine
entertainment.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The goddess was touched. She went out into
the pens, freed the swine, and anointed each one
with a healing salve. And, oh joy! the animals
stood up, the bristly hide and the long snouts disappeared,
and my companions stood before me,
younger and handsomer than before. They shouted
for joy and fell at our feet. Then their beautiful
liberator led them into the banquet hall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Listen, Ulysses,&rsquo; said Circe to me, &lsquo;remain with
me for a while and rest after all the hardships thou
hast undergone. Go and beach thy ship upon the
sands. Hide thy weapons and goods in the thicket,
and then bring all thy worthy comrades here that I
may entertain them.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Confiding in the sacred oath of the goddess I
set out at once to fetch my companions. They
rejoiced to see me returning in safety, and came
running to meet me like young foals to their mother.
I related my adventure, and commanded them to
draw the ship on the beach and to bury the tools
and follow me to the palace where they might rest
and feast to their heart&rsquo;s content.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_84">84</div>
<p>&ldquo;Then arose the prudent Eurylochus, still half-paralyzed
with fear, and said to them: &lsquo;Poor fellows,
where are we going? The crafty sorceress
will soon have transformed us all into swine, wolves,
or lions. Did not Ulysses lead us into the Cyclops&rsquo;
cave. Let us stay here, and let him go where he
will.&rsquo; I grew crimson with anger on hearing him
speak thus. I had already drawn my sword to
cut off his head when my companions prevented
me. &lsquo;Let him go,&rsquo; said they; &lsquo;we will all follow
thee.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I then guided them to Circe&rsquo;s palace, and even
Eurylochus followed us at a distance. How happy
they all were to find their companions, in fine garments,
sitting at the festive board. They fell upon
one another&rsquo;s necks, and even Circe was touched
at the sight. She said to us: &lsquo;Dear comrades, stay
with me until ye shall have forgotten all your
troubles and regained your old-time courage.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thankfully we accepted her invitation, and day
by day we feasted and drank. But at length, when
a year had gone by, the longing for home awakened
in our breasts, and my companions urged me to think
of our native land. All day I mused upon their
demand, and as darkness fell I clasped the knees of
the goddess and besought her to send us back to our
homes. She answered graciously that she did not
wish to detain me against my will, but that I must
first accomplish a mission for her before I could
take the direct path homewards. I gave my promise
and heard with horror the following commission:
&lsquo;I wish to send thee to the underworld to
inquire of the spirit of old Tiresias, who conferred
upon Persephone, Queen of Hades, alone of all the
shades, power to wander there a living person,
while the other souls are only floating shadows.&rsquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_85">85</div>
<p>&ldquo;I wrung my hands and groaned. Weeping I
sat beside the goddess and cried: &lsquo;Who shall show
me the way thither? Never did a living man
descend into Hades, and nevermore shall a living
man return from thence into the light.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Fear not for thy life, nor for a guide,&rsquo; she continued.
&lsquo;Spread thy sail and let the north wind
guide thee.&rsquo; She then gave me full directions as
to all that I should see and do upon this visit to the
lower regions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As she ended dawn was gilding the morning
sky. Sorrowfully I arose and went to arouse my
companions and advise them of our speedy departure.
We went down to the ship with heavy hearts.
There we found the sacrificial sheep, which I was
to carry with me, bound and ready; a black male
sheep and a female. Circe had also provided flour,
wine, and honey. We launched the ship, raised
the mast, and reluctantly embarked. A favorable
wind bore us straight toward the ends of the
earth.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_86">86</div>
<p>&ldquo;We reached the shores of the Cimmerians,
where the sun no longer sheds its light. There we
beached our ship, took the sacrificial gifts, and
descended to the place which Circe had shown me.
We found all as she had foretold. I now began to
dig a pit with my sword, an ell square, and into it
I poured an offering for the dead as I had been instructed;
first of honey and milk, then of sweet
wine, and at last of water, strewing white flour
over all. Then the two sheep were handed me, and
I cut their throats with my sword so that the dark
blood ran into the pit. Immediately the departed
souls floated up in crowds from the lower world
and pressed upon me. But I held them back with
my sword, and commanded my companions to burn
the sheep which had been skinned meanwhile.
While the offering was being consumed we prayed
to all the gods of the lower world, and I did not
forget to make promises to them and to Tiresias,
provided that I should reach Ithaca in safety.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I gazed upon the approaching shades with silent
awe. I saw armed men with deep wounds, old
dames and blooming maidens, careworn old men and
vigorous youths. They crowded about the pit
on all sides with horrible cries, and I had hard work
to keep them from the blood with my sword.</p>

<p class="caption"><i>INVOCATION OF THE SHADES IN HADES</i></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_87">87</div>
<p>&ldquo;The spirits seemed speechless except Tiresias.
He bade me turn away the sharp sword, that he
might drink of the blood and prophesy of my fate.
When he had drunk he leaned upon his golden
staff and began: &lsquo;Noble Ulysses, thou art anxious
to return to thy home, but one of the gods will put
difficulties in thy way. Dost thou not know how
deeply thou didst offend Poseidon in blinding the
eye of his son? Still all may be well with thee if
only thou layest not thine hands upon the steers
of Helios upon the island of Thrinakia. If thou
shouldst kill one of them thou mayest scarcely
expect to be saved, and if thou shouldst ever see
thy native land again, it would only be after many
years of hardship and without any of thy companions.
Others shall feast upon thy substance,
woo thy spouse, and seek to lay deadly traps for
thy son. But at last a divinity shall take pity on
thee that thou mayest slay the presumptuous guests
in thy palace. The deed will compel thee to leave
thine ancestral home and to settle far inland. Then
let it be a token for thee that, when on thy pilgrimage
with thine oar upon thy shoulder, thou shalt
meet a man who shall call the oar a shovel, that it
is the place which the gods have set apart for the
haven of thine old age. Far from the sea, death
shall come gently upon thee.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;So that is to be my fate, O Tiresias,&rsquo; I said.
&lsquo;But tell me, do I not see my old mother amongst
the spirits? She deigns not to speak to her son, nor
looks into my face. What shall I do to make her
know me?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;If thou wouldst question any of these spirits,
let them drink of the blood,&rsquo; answered Tiresias;
&lsquo;then mind and speech shall return to them.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I waited until my mother should approach, and
as soon as she had drunk she recognized me with
joy and astonishment. I recounted to her all my
sufferings and questioned her in what manner she
had died and how my father, wife, and dear son
at home were faring. She told me that all were
alive and longed for me every day, that my father,
grown weak with age, lived in the palace no longer,
but cultivated his vineyards in the country.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_88">88</div>
<p>&ldquo;She departed and in her place came other women,
wives of famous heroes I had known. They, too,
drank of the blood and told me of their fate. My
heart swelled as I beheld the spirits of dear friends
floating near who had once been my companions
before Troy&mdash;Agamemnon, Achilles, Patroclus, and
the excellent Ajax, all of whom death had overtaken
before they saw their native land again. I
was most astonished to see Agamemnon here. I
questioned him and, lamenting, he told me his sad
fate. He inquired about his living son, Orestes, but
alas, I could tell him nothing of the Greeks. But I
was able to tell Achilles of many glorious deeds
done by his son Neoptolemus, of whose bravery in
war I had often been witness after his father&rsquo;s death.
Even in the pale world of shades Achilles rejoiced
in his son&rsquo;s valor, and floated proudly down to the
fields of asphodel where dwell the spirits of brave
heroes.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_89">89</div>
<p>&ldquo;I saw also the heroes of ancient times. Minos,
the wise ruler and lawgiver of Crete, was even now
holding judgment over the souls of the dead in
Hades; and Orion, the great hunter, with his mighty
bow drove innumerable game before him. Tityus,
that gigantic son of earth, who had once dared to
dishonor the divine Leto, mother of Apollo and Artemis,
lay fast bound upon the ground in punishment,
two vultures on either side tearing at his entrails
which ever grew again and were anew destroyed.
Not less terrible was the penalty of Sisyphus, a king
who had practised many cruelties during his lifetime.
He was obliged to push a heavy block of
marble up a steep hill, and as often as he had nearly
reached the top it would glide from his hands and
roll thundering down to the bottom of the valley.
Then, bathed in cold perspiration and in a cloud of
dust, he would begin the difficult task over again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I saw Tantalus also, that celebrated king whom
Jupiter allowed to sit at his own table and feast
with the gods. His vain heart was unworthy of
the honor. He misused their confidence and
betrayed their secrets; and for this he was undergoing
a terrible martyrdom in Hades. A burning
thirst consumes him continually, and though he
stands up to his throat in water, and delicious pear,
fig, and apple trees hang their sweet fruits above
his head, he can never satisfy his vehement desires;
for as often as he bends down to the water the pool
suddenly dries up, and as often as he raises his
hand to pluck of the juicy fruit, a furious wind
quickly tosses the branches toward the clouds. I
saw also the shade of Hercules. He lives in Olympus
with the gods and is married to Hebe, enjoying
the pleasures of the gods in return for all his labor
on earth. Only his shade is in Hades. Theseus
and Pirithous also glided by at a distance.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_90">90</div>
<p>&ldquo;I did not venture to remain much longer in this
dread place, but full of what I had seen and heard,
hastened back to the ship with my companions.
We all went aboard and Oceanus bore us back the
way we had come. Circe had scarcely heard of our
arrival when she visited us and sent us plenty of
bread, meat, and wine. When it began to grow
dark she seated herself by my side, apart from the
others, and gave me much wise advice for my coming
voyage. She warned me against the Sirens who
entice travellers with sweet songs, only to devour
them like beasts of prey. &lsquo;As it is impossible to
resist their entrancing singing,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;take this
piece of wax and knead it into a paste with which
to stop the ears of thy companions; but cause thyself
to be bound to the mast, and when, carried
away by the magic singing, thou wouldst set thyself
free, let them bind thee the faster.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Another and greater danger awaits thee in the
fearful abyss where dwell Scylla and Charybdis.
There the sea is forced between two high rocks
scarcely an arrow&rsquo;s flight apart. Deep at the foot
of one lurks Charybdis, the monster, gulping down
endless streams of water with all ships and men who
approach too near, and long afterwards spitting them
out again dashed to pieces in the turmoil. Beware
of that side and keep closer to the right, where the
other monster, Scylla, dwells. When thou passest by
thou wilt be obliged to pay her a terrible toll, for
with each of her six jaws she will snatch one of
thy men from the rower&rsquo;s bench. But it is better
to lose six men than to see thy whole ship go down
in Charybdis&rsquo; whirlpool. Finally I warn thee of
the sacred oxen of Helios on the island Thrinakia.
Shouldst thou harm one of them, I prophesy destruction
for thee and thy ship and thy friends; and even
if thou shouldst thyself escape, thou shalt return
home only after many years, unhappy and without
any companions.&rsquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_91">91</div>
<p>&ldquo;Thus spake the glorious goddess, and as rosy
Eos appeared we hastened to our ships to take
advantage of a favorable wind. As soon as I thought
we were nearing the Sirens I kneaded the wax and
stopped the ears of my friends; but me they bound
fast to the mast. Thus we rowed on. The Sirens
heard us coming and began their enchanting song.
As I listened I was seized with an overmastering
desire to hear more and struggled to loosen my
bonds. I begged my friends with signs and gestures
to aid me, but they only tied me faster, until
the magical sounds grew fainter and fainter and the
danger was left far behind.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_92">92</div>
<p>&ldquo;We next saw mist and rolling surf and heard hollow
reverberations in the distance. The arms of the
rowers became paralyzed and the ship stood still. I
hastened among them and admonished them to row
as fast as possible, but commanded the steersman
to keep as far to the right as possible, that we might
not be engulfed by Charybdis. I wisely kept silent
about the fearful Scylla, or not a man would have
rowed another stroke. As I stood on the high
deck, armed with two spears and looking down into
the foaming gulf, I heard a cry of pain on my right,
and behold, the fearful monster had seized with her
six jaws the bravest and strongest of my companions.
They called loudly for help, but I could do naught
for them. At last we had passed through the awful
gulf and feasted our eyes on the green hills of Thrinakia.
We could hear the lowing of the splendid
oxen of Helios and the cheerful sound of bleating
herds of sheep. Helios, the Sun-god, had placed
these herds in the care of two nymphs, and delighted
in watching them as often as he guided his golden
chariot over Thrinakia&rsquo;s hills. They never increased
or diminished, neither did they grow old.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Friends,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;this is the fatal island, and I
already see the pleasant flocks of Helios, to touch
which means death. Let us heed the warning of
Tiresias and the divine Circe and avoid the island,
for they have told us that the most terrible fate
awaits us there.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My companions were displeased with my speech
and began to murmur. Eurylochus was their spokesman.
&lsquo;Cruel, but too courageous Ulysses,&rsquo; said he,
&lsquo;thou art never weary, but we are worn out with our
labors and thou begrudgest us rest. Thou wouldst
have us row blindly out into the night. Let us land,
take food, and rest beside the ship. Early in the
morning we can set out again.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All applauded Eurylochus&rsquo; speech, and I perceived
that the god was bent on my destruction. I said to
them: &lsquo;Ye can easily force me, a single man among
many, to obedience. Only swear that ye will not
touch one of those animals, but will be satisfied with
the food which the immortal Circe has given us.&rsquo;
They promised hastily and the steersman put to land.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_93">93</div>
<p>&ldquo;We disembarked and ate our supper. Then we
bewailed the terrible death of our companions, and it
was late before sweet slumber came to dry our
tears. But alas, what an awakening we were to
have. During the night a frightful storm arose
and thick black clouds veiled land and sea. When
morning dawned we drew our ship into a rocky
cove and sheltered ourselves as best we could.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Friends,&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;we shall not get away from
this island to-day, but we have a store of food and
drink. Swear to me once more that none of you
will touch the sacred cattle.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They all promised, but for four long weeks the
south wind and the rough east wind alternated with
each other and our departure was delayed. When
all the store of food had been eaten my companions
scoured the beach to find shellfish or would shoot a
bird for food. But all these were not enough to
appease their gnawing hunger. I, too, wandered
about the island far from the ship, washed my hands
in the sacred sea, and prayed to the gods that one
of them might show me the way to return. When I
had prayed thus a deep sleep overcame me, and I
sank down upon the shore.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When my companions found themselves alone
they determined to break their oath. &lsquo;If Jupiter
has destined us to death, let us be suddenly dashed
to pieces in the ship rather than die miserably of
hunger here,&rsquo; said Eurylochus. &lsquo;Come let us take
some of the oxen and sacrifice them, and vow a
temple in Ithaca to the offended Sun-god as soon as
we are safe at home.&rsquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_94">94</div>
<p>&ldquo;Just as the fat shanks were steaming on the
hastily prepared altar I awoke and came hastening
to the scene. Ye gods! what were my feelings
when I smelled the unexpected odors from afar.
It was vain to blame myself or my companions.
The nymphs had carried the news to Helios, and the
god threatened that unless he should receive sufficient
reparation he would no longer light the world
for gods and men. Upon this, Jupiter promised
him to destroy my ship as soon as I should put to
sea again. Alas, what woes were still in store for
me!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_95">95</div>
<p>&ldquo;For six days my comrades feasted, but on the
seventh, when the fury of the storm had spent itself,
we hastily embarked and sailed rapidly toward
our native coast. We had not gone far when a
terrific west wind arose, piling up black thunder
clouds. Our little vessel was tossed hither and
thither until, with a loud crash, the mainmast
broke off, carrying the steersman with it into the
sea. Then came a frightful bolt of lightning which
split the ship in two and all the rowers were precipitated
into the water, where they tossed about and
then sank. I had clung tightly to the keel, and when
the broken mast with its sail ropes floated near
enough, I bound it fast to the keel. I tried to keep
myself afloat on this miserable raft, but despaired
of ever reaching land, especially as a south wind
suddenly arose, which carried me straight toward
the straits of Scylla. The current bore me toward
the whirlpool of Charybdis, so that only a miracle
could save me. On a cliff directly overhanging the
gulf I saw a fig tree, and just as the whirlpool was
about to suck me down I seized hold of its slender
stem, clinging to it like a bat, for I found no place
for my feet. My raft had been swallowed up, but
I knew that the monster would soon cast it out
again, and sure enough, presently my faithful
raft came floating safely along. I essayed a sudden
leap, grasped the raft desperately, and was carried
out again by the current into the open sea. The
storm had subsided and I paddled about for nine
days with my hands, almost perishing with hunger.
On the tenth day I was fortunate enough to reach
land. It was Ogygia, Calypso&rsquo;s island, where I
was held in captivity for nine years, as I have told
you.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_96">96</div>
<h2 id="c8"><span class="h2line1">Chapter VIII</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">Ulysses is taken sleeping to Ithaca by the Ph&aelig;acians&mdash;Athene counsels him&mdash;He comes to Eum&aelig;us</span></h2>
<p>All eyes were fastened upon the speaker and
all listened with delight to the wonderful
adventures of Ulysses. &ldquo;We should pay
even greater honor to the hero who has suffered so
much,&rdquo; cried Alcinous. &ldquo;Let each of the twelve
princes add a tripod of bronze and a silver basin to
his gift.&rdquo; All agreed and the company broke up
for the night.</p>
<p>At daybreak they reassembled, each bringing his
gift. Alcinous himself went aboard the vessel and
carefully fitted it out with all that was necessary.
Then all repaired once more to the king&rsquo;s palace for
a farewell banquet and sacrificial offering. Ulysses,
longing for home, spake to the king. &ldquo;Most honored
hero and mighty King Alcinous, and ye princes
of the Ph&aelig;acians, speed me now upon my way,
for I have all that heart can wish. May the gods
bless your gifts and my return and send you good
fortune.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_97">97</div>
<p>After the last rites of hospitality had been completed
Ulysses turned to Arete, and putting his cup
into her hand he said: &ldquo;Farewell forever, O Queen,
until old age and death, the lot of all mankind,
shall overtake thee. Mayest thou be happy in
thy palace for many years amongst thy children,
thy husband, and thy people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After taking leave he hurried to the ship and
laid himself down to rest, while the rowers took their
places and bent to their task. Ulysses sank into
a slumber, forgetting all his woes. As the morning
star arose the ship landed in one of Ithaca&rsquo;s bays.
Even the shock of landing did not awaken the hero,
and the Ph&aelig;acian youths carried him gently on shore.
They took out all the presents and piled them beside
him beneath an olive tree. They then re&euml;mbarked
and steered gayly homeward. But the unfortunates
could not escape the wrath of Poseidon. He
saw them returning, and transformed their ship
into a rock in the midst of the sea and surrounded
the city of Ph&aelig;acia with high cliffs.</p>
<p>In the meantime Ulysses awoke and did not recognize
his home, for Athene had surrounded him
with a thick fog. &ldquo;Woe is me,&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;In
what strange country have the deceitful Ph&aelig;acians
left me? What shall I do? I will first examine
the gifts and see if all are here.&rdquo; He counted
them and found none missing. As he was strolling
along, Athene in the form of a lovely little shepherd
boy came toward him. Ulysses was overjoyed.
&ldquo;A greeting to thee, the first being I have met in
this strange land,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I humbly beg of thee
to tell me where I am. What country is this and
by what people inhabited? Is it an island or a
promontory of the mainland?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_98">98</div>
<p>&ldquo;Thou must have come from afar,&rdquo; interrupted
the youth, &ldquo;if thou knowest not this land; for in
truth it is famous enough. To be sure it is rough
and mountainous and not fit for horses, but grain
and wine flourish here and it supports quantities of
cattle and sheep. It is well watered by brooks and
covered with magnificent forests. Indeed the fame
of Ithaca has even reached Troy, and that they say
is far from the Achaian land.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The crafty one hid his feelings, for he did not
wish to be known. &ldquo;Indeed,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I have
often heard the name in Crete, my home. I am a
refugee. The Ph&aelig;acians kindly brought me hither
with these, my goods; for I have slain a king&rsquo;s son
who wished to take from me my booty from the
Trojan wars. Therefore I had to leave wife and
child and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Silence!&rdquo; interrupted Athene, smiling and changing
into a beautiful maiden of heroic stature.
&ldquo;Thou art still the same resourceful Ulysses as of
yore, whom I have always protected. Spare me thy
jests, for we know each other. I am Pallas Athene,
and am now come to give thee counsel how thou mayest
punish the insolent suitors in thy house. For
they have wooed thy virtuous spouse for three years
with marriage gifts, but she repulses them all and
cherishes thy image alone in her heart and longs
unspeakably for thy return.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_99">99</div>
<p>&ldquo;It is difficult indeed to recognize thee in human
form, oh goddess,&rdquo; cried Ulysses. &ldquo;True, thou
hast often appeared to me in battle and in times
of need, but it has seemed to me that lately thou
hadst deserted me and that I should never see thee
again. But tell me, how can this be Ithaca? I do
not recognize it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had not forgotten thee,&rdquo; answered the goddess.
&ldquo;But I did not wish to oppose the mighty
Poseidon, my great uncle, who pursued thee with
his revenge. I knew too that total destruction
was not to be thy destiny. Now I will show thee
the land.&rdquo; And Athene dissipated the mists so
that the country lay clear before them.</p>
<p>Ulysses fell upon his face and joyfully kissed the
sacred mother earth and with uplifted hands prayed
to the nymphs, the protecting goddesses of the place
whereon he stood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now, Ulysses,&rdquo; said Athene, &ldquo;let us hide
thy valuables so that no one shall rob thee of them.&rdquo;
She entered the nymphs&rsquo; grotto and Ulysses handed
her each piece, which she carefully stowed away and
then rolled a stone before the low entrance. Next
they sat down under the old olive tree and Athene
gave him much advice.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_100">100</div>
<p>Although she promised him assistance she counselled
him to proceed very cautiously as the suitors
numbered over one hundred. Above all, nobody
must know of his arrival until he had secretly learned
who his friends were and had assured himself of
sufficient adherents. To this end she wished to
transform him so that no one should recognize
him or suspect the presence of the great king. She
touched him gently with her staff and immediately
he became like an old man with shrunken
flesh and deep wrinkles, white hair and pale, watery
eyes. His long flowing robes were changed into a
coarse and ragged shirt, and his cloak became a
shabby deerskin. In order to complete the beggar&rsquo;s
garb she supplied him with a large wallet and
put a knotty stick into his hand.</p>
<p>In this apparel she bade him first visit the good
swineherd, who was an enemy of the suitors and
was truly devoted to his master. From him he could
soon learn further particulars. In the meanwhile
she would hasten to meet young Telemachus, returning
from Sparta, for whom the suitors were lying
in wait with their ships. She would bring their
schemes to naught and hoped soon to guide the
youth into his father&rsquo;s arms. They parted, and
Ulysses climbed the steep path which led to the
dwelling of the good swineherd, Eum&aelig;us. He was
chief of all the king&rsquo;s herdsmen and had four men
under him, who took care of all the flocks.</p>
<p>The estimable swineherd was sitting at the door
of his hut cutting out sandals to wear when he
should go into the city. By his side lay four savage-looking
dogs. When the beasts saw Ulysses with his
beggar&rsquo;s pack in the distance, they sprang up barking
and ran furiously toward him. He quickly
laid by his staff and bowed himself down, but still
they would have seized him had not the swineherd
followed quickly to enforce his commands with
stones and calls.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_101">101</div>
<p>&ldquo;In truth the beasts came near devouring thee and
thou hadst caused me shame and sorrow, old man,&rdquo;
he cried. &ldquo;I have already troubles enough, for I sit
here grieving bitterly for my dear master, whose fat
swine I am obliged to send daily to the impious men
in his palace, while he, perhaps, goes hungry or wanders
like a beggar among strangers, if perchance he
still sees the light of the sun. But come into my
hut, that I may set bread and wine before thee and
thou canst tell me who and whence thou art.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus speaking he preceded Ulysses into the hut,
where he prepared him a couch of straw covered
with goatskins. Ulysses was touched by his kindness
and said: &ldquo;May Jupiter send thee what thou
most wishest for, friend, in return for thy kindness
to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One should not despise any guest, oh stranger,
however humble,&rdquo; answered the swineherd, &ldquo;for
all strangers are under the protection of Jupiter.
In my house the hospitality is very scanty, for, as
thou knowest, a servant has not much to give. To
be sure, were my old master living and at home I
should be better off. He would have taken good
care of me and have made provision for my old
age in return for my long and faithful service. But
my good master is gone. O that Helen&rsquo;s race
might be destroyed root and branch for bringing
death to so many brave men!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_102">102</div>
<p>With these words he tucked up his long garment,
went to one of the sties, and took out two sucking
pigs. After killing them he slowly roasted them on
the spit at the fire, laid the pieces before Ulysses,
mixed wine in a wooden tankard, and set it before
him. &ldquo;There, stranger,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;eat and drink
of the best we shepherds have. The suitors who
fear neither gods nor men eat the fattened pork.
The gods have always been displeased at deeds of
violence. Even robbers often fear the gods, but
these fear and reverence nothing, and the divinities
have delayed their punishment thus far. The cursed
ones must have secret information that Ulysses
has perished miserably, else would they not waste
his substance so recklessly. No king hereabouts
was so richly blessed with property as Ulysses. He
owned twelve herds of cattle and as many of sheep
and goats. Each of the shepherds must now send
a daily contribution from the fattened flocks to
the palace, and soon all will be dissipated.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The listener was indignant at what he had heard,
but concealed his feelings, and when he had finished
eating he said: &ldquo;What would you think,
friend, if I should bring thee good news? Tell me
the name of thy rich and powerful master. I have
travelled so far that perchance I can tell thee somewhat
of him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Spare thyself the trouble,&rdquo; answered the swineherd.
&ldquo;He will not return. Who knows on what
rocky coast his bones are bleaching? Woe, woe is
me! Neither father nor mother was as dear to me
as my kind master.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_103">103</div>
<p>&ldquo;Listen, my dear fellow,&rdquo; answered Ulysses.
&ldquo;I will swear to thee a sacred oath that Ulysses
shall return. When he has come thou shalt give me
a fine tunic and a cloak in return for my good news.
I do not ask for them now, needy as I am, for I despise
the wretch who lies for gain, even though want
incites him. But hear me. All that I now foretell
shall come to pass. When the present moon
has waned and the new one begins to increase,
Ulysses will be at home and shall have punished all
who have not respected his wife and son.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Silence, old man,&rdquo; interrupted the swineherd.
&ldquo;Drink and talk of something else, and may the
gods forgive thee the oath. Sadness fills my heart.
I am troubled about the son also, the splendid Telemachus,
whom an evil spirit has persuaded to wander
abroad to seek news of his father. I hear that
the shameless suitors are lying in wait for him to
kill him on his return, that the race of Arkisios may
perish. But now, old man, tell me of thy own
troubles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would take me a year to unfold my tale of
woe,&rdquo; answered the artful Ulysses, and began to
tell many stories of his adventures and feats of
bravery. When he had finished, &ldquo;Unhappy man,&rdquo;
said the swineherd, &ldquo;thou hast touched my heart.
But why dost thou tell me lies about Ulysses who
never will return? Thou wilt not thus acquire my
favor; for if I show thee honor and kindness I do
it only in honor of Jupiter and for sympathy for
thy troubles.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_104">104</div>
<p>&ldquo;Thou hast an incredulous heart in thy breast,&rdquo;
cried Ulysses angrily; &ldquo;for thou dost not even believe
my oath. But listen to me; we will make a
bargain. I will stay here until Ulysses comes, and
when he is here thou shalt send me home to Dulichium,
well fitted out with cloak and tunic. If he
cometh not, then shalt thou and thy grooms bind
me and throw me down from this rock.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The gods forbid that I should ever do such a
thing,&rdquo; answered the swineherd. &ldquo;Never could I
pray to Jupiter again should I thus abuse the laws
of hospitality.&rdquo;</p>
<p>During this conversation evening had descended,
and the under herders came in with their beasts.
There was a tremendous grunting, and it was a long
time before all the bristly creatures were safe in
their sties. When they were taken care of, the
swineherd ordered the men to bring in a fatted
five-year-old to regale the guest.</p>
<p>While the men were outside he chopped wood
and laid it on the fire and made all ready. When
the meal was prepared, the good swineherd made a
fair division. He divided each part seven times.
The first part was taken out for the nymphs and Hermes;
the others were for his guest, his four servants,
and himself. The old man received a large piece
of the fat back, the piece of honor which is generally
given to the guest. Ulysses was delighted and said:
&ldquo;Good Eum&aelig;us, mayest thou be as beloved of Jupiter
as thou art of me, whom thou hast so honorably
entertained.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_105">105</div>
<p>&ldquo;Eat, my unhappy friend,&rdquo; answered the kindly
man, &ldquo;and make the most of what thou hast, for
the gods give and take as it pleases them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After supper was over and night had fallen, an
awful west wind whistled through the hut. The
rain fell in torrents. Ulysses shivered miserably in
his rags and it did not seem to occur to the swineherd
to offer him a warm cloak. The hero contrived
a jest to see if he could not get it by craft.
&ldquo;Listen, Eum&aelig;us and ye shepherds,&rdquo; said he.
&ldquo;The wine has made me merry and I must tell ye an
amusing tale. Perhaps it is not fitting that I should
tell it, but as I have begun I will finish it. I have
just been wishing that I were as young and strong
as when I lay with your master before Troy. And
then I recollected a trick by which Ulysses once
helped me in great straits.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One night we had planned an ambush close to
the city wall&mdash;Menelaus, Ulysses, and I&mdash;but we
had taken but a few men with us. Night was
approaching and we lay down in a thicket amongst
reeds and swamp grass. All at once the sky became
overcast and a cruel north wind began to blow.
Snow fell, and our shields were soon encrusted with
ice. I was worse off than the others, for they had
their cloaks in which to wrap themselves and were
covered with their shields. Thus they slept without
feeling the storm. I alone had not brought my
cloak, and was obliged to lie in the rain in my thin
tunic. My teeth chattered and I shook as though
in a fever.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_106">106</div>
<p>&ldquo;At length, past midnight, when I could no longer
endure it, I nudged Ulysses who lay beside me, and
said: &lsquo;Noble Ulysses, I am nearly dying of cold,
for I left my cloak behind. Do thou devise something
for me.&rsquo; &lsquo;Keep quiet,&rsquo; he said softly. Then
raising his voice he awakened the others. &lsquo;Listen,
friends,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;I have just had a memorable
dream. There are so few of us and we are so far
from the ships, someone should run to Agamemnon
and tell him to send us aid.&rsquo; Thoas, Andr&aelig;mon&rsquo;s
son, obligingly set out, leaving his purple cloak
upon the ground. Ulysses tossed it to me and I
laughingly wrapped myself therein and slept till
morning. You see, friends, I was thinking that
were I now as young and strong as then that perhaps
someone would give me a robe for the night,
either out of good-will or for fear of my strength.
But of course the humble man in beggar&rsquo;s garb is
despised.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The men laughed and the swineherd praised the
stranger&rsquo;s cunning. &ldquo;Thou hast spoken well,&rdquo;
he said, &ldquo;and hast drawn a very good comparison.
Therefore I will give thee what thou desirest.
Take this cloak, but in the morning thou must
give it back, for we shepherds have few clothes.
If Telemachus should return he will doubtless
give thee garments and send thee back to thy
home.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_107">107</div>
<p>While speaking he prepared a couch of sheep and
goat skins by the hearth for the guest and placed
a cloak over it to cover him. The servants lay
down beside Ulysses, but the swineherd did not
sleep within, but carefully guarding his herds he
bivouacked nightly in a cleft by the rock which sheltered
him from the north wind. Ulysses was much
pleased with the good man&rsquo;s faithful service.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_108">108</div>
<h2 id="c9"><span class="h2line1">Chapter IX</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">Telemachus leaves Sparta and lands in Ithaca</span></h2>
<p>In the meanwhile Athene had not ceased planning
for her favorites. That same night she
went to Menelaus&rsquo; palace in Sparta to admonish
Telemachus to return home and to warn him of
the dangers lying in wait for him. &ldquo;When thou
art near the shores of Ithaca,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;let thy
companions row immediately to the city, but do
thou go alone to the hut of old Eum&aelig;us, who is
honestly devoted to thee, to spend the night. Let
him hasten to the city to tell Penelope of thy safe
arrival.&rdquo; With these words the goddess disappeared.
When morning dawned Telemachus arose
and met Menelaus, who was also abroad, and immediately
begged to be allowed to depart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Far be it from me, dear youth, to keep thee
here against thy will,&rdquo; answered Menelaus. &ldquo;But
wait at least until I can give thee parting gifts and
have the women prepare a good meal, that thou
mayest set out strengthened and refreshed.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_109">109</div>
<p>Menelaus bade the maids prepare a repast in
haste and himself went into the treasury to select
a gift for the departing guests. Helen also opened
her chest, which held beautifully embroidered garments
worked by her own hands. She took out
the largest and finest one for Telemachus. Menelaus
followed her with a golden goblet and a silver
pitcher. He presented them, saying: &ldquo;May Jupiter
grant thee a prosperous voyage. Behold I am
giving thee the most valuable thing that I possess.
It was a present from the Sidonian king when I
passed through Ph&oelig;nicia. Truly it is as cunning
a piece of work as though made by Heph&aelig;stos
himself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I, too, desire to make thee a present,&rdquo; said Helen,
holding out the magnificent robe. &ldquo;Let it adorn
the bride on thy wedding day. Until then let thy
worthy mother keep it in her chest. Fare thee
well, and return in peace to thy stately palace and
land of thy fathers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Telemachus received the splendid gifts with
gratitude and gave them to Pisistratus, who in silent
admiration stowed them away in the chariot. Then
they all went into the hall and sat down to the banquet.
As soon as it was over, the two youths
hastened to depart, and Menelaus accompanied
them to their chariot with a goblet of wine, drinking
to their health and giving them a final hand clasp
with the words: &ldquo;Farewell, youths. Bear my greeting
to father Nestor who truly loved me like a
father when we were fighting before Troy.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_110">110</div>
<p>After taking leave of their fathers&rsquo; friends the
two youths travelled rapidly until they reached
Pylos. Then Telemachus said to Pisistratus: &ldquo;I
wish thou wouldst grant a request, good host. Drive
me directly to my ship on the beach, so that the
venerable Nestor may not detain me with his kindly
hospitality; for I am in great haste.&rdquo; Pisistratus
agreed to this, and Telemachus&rsquo; companions were
overjoyed to see him again and at once prepared
for departure. When all was ready, Telemachus
placed himself at the rudder and with a silent prayer
poured a libation to Athene into the sea, and they
rowed away into the silent night.</p>
<p>In the meanwhile the beggar Ulysses sat in the
hut of good Eum&aelig;us partaking of his humble fare.
&ldquo;Listen, Eum&aelig;us,&rdquo; he began. &ldquo;I have been a burden
to thee long enough, and intend to go into town
early to-morrow morning. All I ask is that thou
wilt give me a guide to show me the way to Ulysses&rsquo;
palace. I desire to bring tidings to Penelope and to
mix with the suitors and see whether they are
inclined to treat me kindly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What art thou thinking of, old man?&rdquo; cried
Eum&aelig;us angrily. &ldquo;Thou wouldst fare ill shouldst
thou fall among that company, whose high-handed
manners are beyond belief. Thou art not in my
way. Wait at least until Ulysses&rsquo; son comes back,
and he will doubtless give thee a good cloak and
coat and provide a vessel to take thee where thou
wishest to go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Excellent swineherd,&rdquo; answered the crafty
Ulysses, &ldquo;may Jupiter love thee as I do for giving
me rest and shelter in thy hut after all my sorrows.
If I am to stay, then tell me somewhat of the mother
of the famous Ulysses; also of his aged father.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_111">111</div>
<p>Upon this the old man began to talk of Laertes
and the good mother, who had long ago succumbed
to sorrow and been laid in the grave. The servants
had long since betaken themselves to rest, and when
midnight came the host said: &ldquo;Now we too will
sleep a little. But it is sweet to pour out one&rsquo;s
troubles, and thou art a sensible man to whom it is
a pleasure to talk. There is always time enough
for sleep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>During this same night the ship which carried
Telemachus had approached the island in safety,
having escaped the vigilance of the spies, and landed
on the northern coast. With the first rays of the
rising sun Telemachus disembarked with his companions
and offered sacrifice. The good youth
little suspected how near his father was. He bound
on the shining sandals and took the heavy lance,
prepared to separate from his companions whom he
ordered to row to the city. He appointed a meeting
the next day in his father&rsquo;s palace to offer them the
journey&rsquo;s meed&mdash;a stately banquet of meat and
wine.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_112">112</div>
<p>Telemachus had but one more care. In Pylos
a soothsayer from Argos, Theoclymenus, had joined
his company and requested passage in the ship.
They had gladly brought him to Ithaca, but he
wanted to go farther, and Telemachus was so afraid
of the suitors that he scarcely dared bring a guest
with him to his house. They therefore consulted
together as to where the stranger should be entertained.
Telemachus proposed Eurymachus, the most
insolent of the suitors, as host, as he was the most
important man on the island and could best entertain
and send him on his way. &ldquo;He is now, as my
father is away,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;almost the supreme
ruler here and is determined to marry my mother,
so that he may acquire, together with the property
of my family, also the title of king and the principal
seat in the folks&rsquo; assembly, which of right belongs
to our house. Now Jupiter only knows
whether or not he will gain his ends.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As he said this, behold, to their right a vulture,
holding a dove in its talons, flew past. It was
tearing the dove in its flight, so that its feathers
fell to the earth between Telemachus and his ship.
Then Theoclymenus took the youth quickly aside
and said softly: &ldquo;Friend, what thou hast just spoken
shall never be fulfilled. This token of the gods
tells me that rule over the princes of Ithaca shall
always remain with thy house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The heart of Telemachus was filled with joy at
this prophecy. He bade the stranger farewell,
and one of his men conducted him to the dwelling
of Eurymachus, while Telemachus went to the hut
of the swineherd, as Athene had commanded him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_113">113</div>
<h2 id="c10"><span class="h2line1">Chapter X</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">Arrival of Telemachus&mdash;Ulysses reveals himself to his Son</span></h2>
<p>When Telemachus reached the enclosure
of the chief herder, the sun was already
high in the heavens. The shepherds
had scattered with their flocks and herds in fields
and forest, and the excellent Eum&aelig;us was lying with
Ulysses before the blazing fire where they had just
roasted a piece of meat for their breakfast. &ldquo;Listen,
I hear footsteps,&rdquo; said Ulysses, &ldquo;and the dogs do
not bark. It must be one of thy comrades or
acquaintances.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Scarcely were the words spoken when Telemachus
appeared in the gateway, the dogs leaping
about him in joyful welcome. The swineherd was
so astonished that he let fall his cup and hurried
out to meet the new arrival. He threw his arms
about him, wept over him, and gazed upon him in
delight as though he had arisen from the dead.
It was a long time before he could speak, and then he
broke out tenderly: &ldquo;Hast thou really come, Telemachus?
Art thou here, my sweet life? I feared
never to see thee again, when I heard that thou hadst
sailed for Pylos. But enter, dear son, that I may
delight in thee; for not often dost thou visit the
shepherd, preferring to mingle with the swarm of
suitors in the city.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_114">114</div>
<p>&ldquo;How canst thou talk thus, old man?&rdquo; interrupted
the youth. &ldquo;But never mind. I have come
to thee to find out whether my mother has listened
to one of the suitors and left my poor house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, indeed,&rdquo; answered Eum&aelig;us. &ldquo;She still
sits and weeps away her days and nights in thy
palace. Thou wilt find her as thou didst leave her.&rdquo;
The two now entered the hut, and the unknown beggar
whose heart was beating with joy at the sight of
his handsome son controlled himself with difficulty.
With the deference of the poor he arose from his
couch to give place to the stranger, but Telemachus
prevented him, saying: &ldquo;Sit still, stranger. I will
find a seat somewhere.&rdquo; Eum&aelig;us brought out the
remains of the meal and they all sat down to eat
and drink. At length Telemachus said: &ldquo;Now,
father Eum&aelig;us, do thou go to the city for me and
bring the news secretly to Penelope that I am safely
returned from Pylos. But take care that no suitor
hears it, for many enemies are plotting against me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be it so,&rdquo; said the herdsman, putting on his
sandals and taking up his staff. Ulysses was still
looking after him, when he saw through the half-opened
gate the figure of a tall, slender maiden,
beckoning to him. The dogs slunk into the corners,
but Telemachus did not perceive the apparition.
Ulysses divined that it was the goddess and went
out to the gateway.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_115">115</div>
<p>&ldquo;Noble son of Laertes,&rdquo; Athene addressed him,
&ldquo;the time has now come for thee to reveal thyself to
thy son. Take counsel with him how ye may make
an end of the suitors. I shall soon be with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While speaking she touched him with her golden
staff and instantly his beggar&rsquo;s dress was transformed
into a fine purple cloak and his wrinkled face into
a fresh manly countenance and the bald head was
covered with shining brown locks. He re&euml;ntered
the hut, from which he had just issued in rags,
looking like a king. Telemachus gazed at him in
astonishment and said, uncertainly: &ldquo;Stranger, how
changed thou art. Ah, I feel that a god approaches.
Be merciful to us, thou holy one. Gladly will we
sacrifice to thee and bring thee gifts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; cried Ulysses, &ldquo;I am not a god. I am the
father for whom thou hast mourned so long. I am
Ulysses.&rdquo; Joyfully he clasped his son in his arms
and kissed him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doubt no longer, dear son,&rdquo; continued Ulysses.
&ldquo;It was not I who worked the miracle, but Athene,
who is with me. The gods can do all things; they
can glorify or disfigure a mortal according to their
pleasure. Yes, it is I, Ulysses, who have been wandering
afar for twenty years, and thou art my beloved
son. I have found my greatest happiness in holding
thee here in my arms.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He could say no more for sobbing. Father and
son wept for some time, closely clasping each other.
Ever and anon they would gaze silently at each other,
then break out in tears of joy and gratitude.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_116">116</div>
<p>At length began tender questionings, but the
answers had to be left for leisure days. Now they
must discuss the great question. A long time was
spent in consultation and Ulysses instructed his
son how to proceed and how to receive him when
he should arrive at the palace. In the meanwhile
the vessel which had brought Telemachus had sailed
round the island and entered the harbor near the
city. The men beached the ship. One faithful
youth took Telemachus&rsquo; gifts away with him,
another ran to Ulysses&rsquo; palace to bring the queen
news of her son&rsquo;s return. But he was so imprudent
as to cry out the news to her before all the suitors,
who gnashed their teeth with rage over the failure
of their schemes and stole away to concoct secretly
new ones.</p>
<p>Soon afterward honest Eum&aelig;us also arrived with
his secret message, but found he was too late, and
at once set out again for his home, where he arrived
in the evening. Athene had again clothed the king
in his beggar&rsquo;s rags, so that Eum&aelig;us had no idea
of what had taken place during his absence. He
quickly selected a year-old pig for the evening meal,
waited upon his guests carefully, and they all retired
early to rest and received the good gift of sleep.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_117">117</div>
<h2 id="c11"><span class="h2line1">Chapter XI</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">Ulysses and the Goatherd&mdash;the Dog Argos&mdash;Ulysses in the Hall among the Suitors</span></h2>
<p>At daybreak Telemachus arose, put on his
sandals, and took up his lance. &ldquo;Now
fare thee well, father,&rdquo; he said to Eum&aelig;us.
&ldquo;I am going to the city, for my mother will not cease
worrying until she sees me. I charge thee bring
thy guest to my house, where he may try his luck,
and help shall not fail him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is well,&rdquo; said Ulysses. &ldquo;In the city, where
there are many rich people, a beggar can make his
way better than in the country. The morning air
is cold and my rags are thin, so let me warm myself
a while at the fire and then I shall be ready.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Telemachus walked quickly away. He reached
town before the suitors had arrived at his house,
placed his lance, according to custom, outside the
door against a pillar, and entered the hall. There
the old servant Euryclea was dusting and arranging
the cushions. When she saw the youth she hastened
to him weeping; the other maids also welcomed
him and kissed his face and shoulders. Penelope
also came and embraced her beloved son with tears.
She held him for a long time in her arms and begged
him to tell her what he had heard on his journey.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_118">118</div>
<p>&ldquo;Mother,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;do not make me speak of
new troubles, for I have scarce escaped death.
But now bathe thyself and put on clean garments,
then ascend to the housetop and vow a thank-offering
to the gods if they will avenge the shame of our
house. I am going to the market place to fetch the
stranger who accompanied me on my return.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He went, and his mother obeyed his behests.
When Telemachus crossed the market place he found
all the suitors assembled there. They greeted him
pleasantly, but their hearts were full of mischief.
He did not join them, but seated himself with the
few older men who had remained true to his father,
and answered their curious questions. As soon as
he caught sight of the seer Theoclymenus, he arose
and went to him and took him to his house, before
the rough crowd had arrived. While Telemachus
was entertaining his guest, Penelope came in with
her women and sat down to spin and listen to the
tale of her son&rsquo;s adventures. He did not dare to
betray the secret of his father&rsquo;s arrival, so that
Penelope&rsquo;s longing remained unsatisfied until the
cheering assurance came from the strange seer that
unfailing signs portended the early return of her
beloved husband.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_119">119</div>
<p>In the midst of her joy over this the queen was
disturbed by the hubbub of the brawling suitors,
who had been amusing themselves by throwing
quoits outside the palace and now burst into the hall
to feast and drink as usual. She went straight to
her chamber, and the stranger, too, left the hall.
The servants began slaughtering the beeves, goats,
swine, and sheep in the courtyard and preparing
delicious dishes for the suitors.</p>
<p>Ulysses had remained until noon in the herdsman&rsquo;s
hut. The road to the city was long, and the
circuitous mountain path led past a well where the
maidens were accustomed to draw water. An
altar had been erected on the height where passing
travellers made offerings to the nymphs of the
spring. At this well the goatherd Melantheus met
with the two wayfarers. He was an impudent
fellow, unfaithful to his master, and ready for any
mischief that the suitors should devise. He was
an arch enemy of the swineherd, as of all honest
people. Hardly had he caught sight of him accompanied
by a ragged beggar than he called out with
coarse raillery: &ldquo;It is a true saying that one beggar
leads the other. How the gods do pair like with
like. Where art thou going with the hungry one,
thou ignoble swineherd? Shall he stand at the door
of the palace in his hideous garb to disgust the gay
guests, to rub his shoulders at the doorposts, and
beg for crumbs? If thou wouldst give him to me,
to sweep out the stalls and make beds for the young
kids, he might get some flesh on his bones. But of
course, beggars&rsquo; bread is easily gained. I tell thee,
if thou bringest the nasty fellow to the palace, bones
and joints in scores will fly at his head.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_120">120</div>
<p>With these insulting words he gave poor Ulysses
a sharp kick. Ulysses reflected for a moment
whether he should dash the wretch to the ground&mdash;an
easy task for him&mdash;or pretend to be weak
and fearful. He chose the latter course and took
the insult humbly. But Eum&aelig;us defied the goatherd
to his face and prayed to the holy nymphs of
the well that they should cause Ulysses to return
and punish the wretch. To avoid the fellow the
two companions let him go ahead with his goats.
&ldquo;Thou dog,&rdquo; he called back, &ldquo;some day I shall
pack thee aboard ship and sell thee as a slave.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Ulysses and the swineherd approached
the royal palace, the beggar exclaimed with profound
emotion: &ldquo;Ah! one can see that this must be the
stately dwelling of Ulysses. Inside, sounds of festivity,
and outside the defiant battlements the impregnable
wall. A rich and mighty king must live
here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do thou enter first,&rdquo; he said to Eum&aelig;us.
&ldquo;I will soon follow.&rdquo; Thus they passed into the
courtyard. Behold, in the corner on the dunghill
lay a dog called Argos. He was thin and wasted
and swarming with vermin. A year before his
departure for Troy, Ulysses had trained this dog
for the chase. He had often played with him as
a puppy, but when he had gone, Argos had been
neglected. Now he was too weak to crawl, but
when he saw Ulysses near to him he raised himself
painfully and wagged his tail. When he tried to
run to his master his legs gave way and down he
sank. Ulysses recognized the faithful animal and
turned aside to brush away a tear. Then he said
to Eum&aelig;us: &ldquo;Tell me, Eum&aelig;us. The animal there
on the dunghill is well built. Was he not fleet of
foot?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_121">121</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered the swineherd; &ldquo;he, too, misses
his good master. Thou shouldst have seen him
twenty years ago. He was his master&rsquo;s favorite,
for he had trained him, and no prey was so swift
that Argos could not overtake it. But no one tends
him now, and he has to pick up a miserable living
in the courtyard. Servants are careless when the
master is abroad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The swineherd entered the house and was spied
by Telemachus, who called him to his side where
he was served with bread and meat. But Ulysses
remained a while without to watch the faithful dog
draw his last breath. Then he, too, entered the house
and seated himself near the door in the hall.</p>
<p>At first the feasters did not notice him, but Telemachus
sent him food. He laid it down upon the
dirty wallet and ate, while the minstrel sang sweet
songs to the music of his harp. When the singer
had finished, Ulysses went among the suitors to
collect alms, that he might discover which ones
were kindly disposed and which were hard and
cruel. Many gave to him pityingly and asked one
another in surprise who the old man was and whence
he came. &ldquo;The swineherd brought him here,&rdquo;
cried Melantheus. &ldquo;Who he is I know not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Swineherd,&rdquo; grumbled Antinous, &ldquo;why didst
thou bring this fellow to the city? I thought there
were plenty of us already to eat up the absent master&rsquo;s
substance, and we could do without beggars.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_122">122</div>
<p>&ldquo;Not seemly is thy speech, Antinous, although
thou art noble,&rdquo; answered the swineherd. &ldquo;Thou
wert always hard on Ulysses&rsquo; servants, and especially
on me. However, I take no notice so long as
Penelope and Telemachus live in this palace.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hush, Eum&aelig;us,&rdquo; interrupted Telemachus.
&ldquo;Thou knowest Antinous. If that is thy only
scruple, Antinous, that the alms which thou givest
the poor come from my store, do not refrain from giving.
Neither my mother nor I begrudge them.
But that is not thy real meaning. Thou wouldst
rather use it all thyself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thou insolent young cub,&rdquo; interrupted Antinous.
&ldquo;If each of the suitors would send him what
I do, he would not enter the house again in three
months.&rdquo; He accompanied these words with a
motion toward a footstool under the table, and was
just going to throw it at the beggar&rsquo;s head when a
neighbor seized his arm.</p>
<p>Ulysses desired to tempt the ungovernable man
further. He went up to him and begged an alms,
and even tried to touch his heart by relating his
wanderings and hardships. But Antinous harshly
bade him begone, and Ulysses retired with the
words: &ldquo;Truly, Antinous, thy body and thy mind
are not in harmony.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_123">123</div>
<p>&ldquo;Was there ever such an insolent beggar!&rdquo; cried
Antinous angrily. &ldquo;Now truly, thou shalt not leave
the hall unpunished,&rdquo; and with all his might he threw
the footstool, which struck Ulysses&rsquo; shoulder. He
stood firm as a rock, only shaking his head in silence,
then returned to the gate and sat down, opening his
wallet.</p>
<p>Telemachus could hardly contain himself, and
even Penelope, who could hear all from her balcony,
pitied the stranger whom she could not see.
She desired Eum&aelig;us to conduct the strange man
to her, that she might talk with him and supply
him with fine raiment.</p>
<p>But he replied: &ldquo;I should like nothing better than
to see the queen, for I have much to tell her, but I
fear the cruel suitors. Bid the noble Penelope wait
for me in her apartments until the sun is set. Then
she may question me about her husband&rsquo;s return.&rdquo;
And he remained quietly sitting on the doorstep,
while his guests, having no idea that he was really
their host, amused themselves, after the banquet
was over, with singing and dancing. How he longed
to have them go, that he might at last see his dear
wife once more. But before he did so he was to
have another strange adventure.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_124">124</div>
<h2 id="c12"><span class="h2line1">Chapter XII</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">Ulysses and Irus, the Beggar</span></h2>
<p>A beggar called Irus entered the hall.
He was tall and thin, in spite of being
well fed, and was a favorite with the
suitors; for he was useful to them in many ways.
He was greatly astonished to find his place already
occupied and looked at the old man angrily and disdainfully,
and relying on his own size and the support
of the suitors, he began, masterfully: &ldquo;Get out
of here or I will throw thee out! Up at once! In
a hurry now! Listen, thou villain! If thou dost
not move quickly there will be trouble between
us!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ulysses greeted him with dark looks and began:
&ldquo;Miserable creature, what have I done to thee?
I do not begrudge thee thy part, and there is room
for both of us here. Do not talk of fighting between
us, for old as I am I should probably spill thy blood
and rid me of thee for a long time to come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha,&rdquo; cried Irus, angrily. &ldquo;He talks like a
washerwoman. I have a great mind to crack thy
jaw. Come here and gird thyself, that all may see
how I shall use thee!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_125">125</div>
<p>Thus far the suitors had paid no heed to the beggar&rsquo;s
quarrel, but now Antinous pricked up his ears
and cried laughingly: &ldquo;Here is an amusing comedy.
The stranger there and Irus have challenged each
other.&rdquo; All sprang from their seats laughing and
formed a circle about the two.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen,&rdquo; said Antinous. &ldquo;Here is a delicious
morsel of tripe for the victor, and in future he shall
drink and eat with us and be the only beggar allowed
to enter here henceforth.&rdquo; This proposal
met with universal approval.</p>
<p>Slowly Ulysses arose, pretending to be stiff in
every joint. Said he: &ldquo;It is hard that an old man
weakened by want should be obliged to contend
with a younger. But hunger forces me to try my
luck. Only swear to me that no one shall assist
Irus or mix in the fight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ulysses made ready by tucking up his rags, revealing
naked shoulders, arms, and legs&mdash;and
how powerful they were! The suitors were astonished.
Irus also had misgivings and would have
been glad to recall his rash words. As he hesitated
the servants led him forward, trembling.
Antinous forced him to the fore and the fight began.
Ulysses reflected whether he should break the
wretch&rsquo;s skull with his fist or only lay him low with
a moderate blow. He wisely decided on the latter,
so that the suitors should not become suspicious.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_126">126</div>
<p>Irus let fly and struck his adversary&rsquo;s shoulder.
But immediately he received a fearful stroke on his
jaw from below, so that blood streamed from his
mouth. With a shriek he sank down, pressed both
hands over his face, and drummed with his feet
for pain. The suitors set up a shout of laughter,
but Ulysses drew the conquered man out into the
courtyard by his heels and laid him in a corner.
He replaced his old rags, took up his wallet, and
returned to his place on the threshold. They all
came up laughing, to shake hands with him, and
Antinous laid the roasted tripe on his wallet, while
Amphinomus brought him bread and wine and drank
to him with a hearty handshake and a toast for
better times.</p>
<p>Before all this had come to pass Athene had
inspired Penelope with the idea of appearing among
the suitors and putting a stop to their plundering
by means of cunning words. The goddess wished
to give the unrecognized beggar the happiness of
seeing his excellent wife in all her majesty and the
pure light of her innocence and faithfulness. Invested
with divine beauty by the goddess, Penelope
descended clad in a charming robe, her face
covered with a long veil and accompanied by two
serving maids. As she entered the hall, all gazed
at her admiringly, each wishing that she might
choose him for her husband.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By all the gods, noble Penelope,&rdquo; cried Eurymachus,
&ldquo;if all the sons of Greece could see thee,
thy palace would be even more full of suitors than
it is now&mdash;thou art so far superior to all other
women in beauty and in nobility of soul.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_127">127</div>
<p>&ldquo;Alas, Eurymachus,&rdquo; she answered, &ldquo;the gods
destroyed my beauty when my dear husband sailed
against Troy. If only he were restored to me, I
should lead a glorious life; but now I mourn in sorrow,
anxiety, and solitude. When he gave me his
hand for the last time he said: &lsquo;Dear wife, I am
going to a long war in a distant country. The
gods alone know whether I shall return. Take care
of the house and our property, consider my father
and mother, and bring up our son carefully. When
he has grown to manhood, if I have not returned,
make room for him in the house and do thou wed
with another.&rsquo; Alas, I did not think that it would
ever be; but to my sorrow fate has decreed that the
fatal day of my espousals draws near. And what
manner of wooing is this? It is customary for the
suitors of a rich man&rsquo;s daughter themselves to bring
the beeves and fatted calves for the feast and to
invite the bride&rsquo;s friends and to bring her rich gifts.
But who has ever heard of their squandering the
substance of the bride whom they are wooing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The suitors were ashamed and promised to bring
the beautiful Penelope handsome presents next day,
and she did indeed receive richer gifts than ever a
bride before. When she had retired, the suitors
continued their sport.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_128">128</div>
<p>As night fell the maids appeared to light the lamps.
That meant, in ancient times, to burn shavings in
a brazier on high pedestals and then to renew the
shavings when they had burned low. Ulysses said
to them: &ldquo;Go ye rather to the apartments of the
amiable queen. Turn the spindle and comb the
wool and bring her cheer. Leave the blazing
torches to me.&rdquo; They only laughed at him, but
when he threatened to tell Telemachus, they ran
hastily away and left him. He tended the lights,
meanwhile observing carefully all that the suitors did
and said.</p>
<p>Although he had seemed to gain their favor by
his successful fight, still they could not long desist
from teasing and mockery. &ldquo;Look, friends,&rdquo; laughingly
cried Eurymachus, &ldquo;this beggar must be
some good. See the glow which surrounds his bald
head. Such a halo belongs only to the immortals.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The laughter of the crowd encouraged Eurymachus
to continue his raillery. &ldquo;Listen, old man. If
thou wert not accustomed to a lazy, wandering life,
I might have work for thee. How sayest thou?
Wilt be my servant? Plough, plant trees, and carry
leaves for bedding? I would pay thee well, give
thee good raiment and sandals for thy feet. But
doubtless thou wouldst rather idle about and fill
thy hungry stomach at thy leisure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O Eurymachus,&rdquo; Ulysses proudly answered,
&ldquo;were we both ploughing or mowing in the field,
working against each other, it were a question which
would earn the prize. And truly were we to go
into battle and were I armed with helmet and harness,
with sword and shield in my hands, thou
shouldst see me at the front. Because thou art
the strongest among many weaklings, thou thinkest
thyself great and powerful. But I believe if
Ulysses should appear, both leaves of the door
would be too narrow for thee.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_129">129</div>
<p>&ldquo;Hear how saucy the fellow is getting,&rdquo; cried
Eurymachus. &ldquo;I will teach thee then to defy me!&rdquo;
And he seized his footstool and cast it at Ulysses,
who, however, quickly bent down and threw himself
at Amphinomus&rsquo; feet. The stool flew over
him and hit the arm of the servant, whose wine-jar
fell from his hand, while he tumbled over backwards.</p>
<p>Angrily and noisily the suitors crowded forward,
threatening the stranger. But Telemachus rose
up and admonished them to be still and quietly
leave the palace, as it was time for sleep. Biting
their lips in anger, the suitors were astonished at
the courage of the usually mild Telemachus. The
gentle Amphinomus supported him and spoke
conciliatingly, and so they all went to their homes,
after making the final sacrifice to the gods.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_130">130</div>
<h2 id="c13"><span class="h2line1">Chapter XIII</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">Ulysses and Penelope</span></h2>
<p>Ulysses remained behind, and as soon as
the suitors had gone, he made a sign to
Telemachus to assist him in carrying all
the weapons to the upper rooms. And behold, as
they carried the swords and shields up the stairs,
the dark passageway was filled with a mysterious
light. &ldquo;It is from the gods. Athene is with us,&rdquo;
said the wise man. &ldquo;Thus are the immortals wont
to manifest themselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When all the weapons had been disposed of, the
father bade his son go to bed, while he betook himself
to the hall to await Penelope. She came from
her chamber like the goddess Aphrodite. Her
maidens placed a seat for her by the hearth and
mended the fire. When the bright flames shot up
and they saw the old beggar still there, they began
to scold, and one even to threaten him with a firebrand
if he did not leave at once. But the queen
reproved the maid as she deserved. At the same
time she ordered a seat for the guest placed opposite
her own by the fireside, and when he was seated,
began to question him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_131">131</div>
<p>He was unwilling to deceive his dear wife, but
she was so determined to learn his name and origin
that he was obliged to spin the same web of lies
with which he had deceived the swineherd. He
also told how he had seen Ulysses, twenty years
before, in Crete, when he had called for him and
Idomeneus on the journey to Troy. At this point
the crafty Penelope, wishing to test his veracity,
asked: &ldquo;Worthy guest, if thou hast entertained my
husband in thy father&rsquo;s house, tell me how he was
apparelled and who was with him then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I remember perfectly,&rdquo; answered the beggar.
&ldquo;He wore a magnificent cloak of dark, shaggy wool,
fastened with a golden bar across the breast. It
bore a splendid embroidery of gold&mdash;a young
roebuck seized by a dog&mdash;and most lifelike were
the rigid dog and the struggling buck trying to free
itself with its feet. A fine tunic of shining white
wool peeped from under the purple mantle. He
was a stately hero, and the women looked upon
him with pleasure. I cannot remember all his
attendants. Only the herald I remember, for he
was a humpback, and I think they called him Eurybates.
The hero loved him above all the others for
his devotion.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_132">132</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, he was very fond of him,&rdquo; said Penelope,
sobbing. During the whole recital her tears had
been flowing. &ldquo;Yes, stranger, thou hast spoken
the truth. I wove those clothes myself and
fastened that clasp on them for an ornament. Ah!
how handsome my good lord looked in those garments.
Alas, how I have hoped for his return,
how I have wept for him, and what I have suffered
daily from the suitors thou canst not imagine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ulysses controlled himself with almost superhuman
power. &ldquo;Weep no more, most excellent of
women. Let me rather finish my tale, for I still
have much of comfort to tell thee. He for whom
thou mournest will surely soon be here. I swear
by Jove and by this hospitable hearth that I have
told the truth and that all shall come to pass as I
have said.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, ye maidens! Honor this man in my
house. Prepare a bed and covers for him, that he
may rest in quiet and comfort,&rdquo; said Penelope.
&ldquo;To-morrow morning ye shall bathe and anoint
him, that he may take his place worthily among
the men and partake of the feast at Telemachus&rsquo;
side. And woe to them who shall insult or mock
at him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Worthy lady,&rdquo; answered Ulysses, &ldquo;I have not
been used to fine beds or soft covers since I left
Crete; so let me remain here by the fire. And none
of the maids shall touch me, unless it be that among
thy household is some faithful old woman who
hath suffered as much as I. Her I would allow to
wash my feet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear guest,&rdquo; answered Penelope, &ldquo;I have such a
faithful soul. She nursed my dear husband and was
his servant from childhood. She shall wash thy feet.
Good Euryclea, come hither and perform the long-neglected
task. Think that it might be thy dear
master whom thou didst so love to serve.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_133">133</div>
<p>These memories caused the old nurse to shed
bitter tears. &ldquo;Alas,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;the gods are my
witnesses that I loved my noble master like a son.
And now I will take good care of thee, as my mistress
has commanded; and gladly too, for I must confess,
stranger, from the first moment when I looked upon
thee, it seemed to me that I had never seen a man
so like Ulysses in voice and figure as thou art.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All who have known us both, good dame, say
the same, and everywhere men have called me
Ulysses, in sport,&rdquo; answered the crafty one.</p>
<p>The old woman now brought the tub with warm
water. Meanwhile the beggar had turned his back
to the blaze, for he had suddenly bethought him
that he was in danger of discovery. Since early
youth he had had a deep scar above his right knee,
where a furious boar had wounded him in the hunt.
Euryclea knew this scar too well; therefore he placed
himself in the shadow that she might not see it.
But in spite of this she discovered it as soon as her
hand touched it, and in joyful surprise she let fall
his leg, overturning the tub of water. Fortunately
Penelope had gone out for a moment and did not
hear the old woman&rsquo;s cry of joy. Ulysses sprang
up quickly, putting his hand over her mouth and
whispering hurriedly: &ldquo;Foster mother, wilt thou
ruin me? Be silent, if life is dear to thee, that
no one in this palace may learn that Ulysses has
returned.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_134">134</div>
<p>&ldquo;Thou knowest my heart is true and faithful,&rdquo;
answered the worthy Euryclea. Then Penelope
returned and seated herself opposite the beggar
once more. &ldquo;Alas,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;it seems as though
I never should find rest. Every night I am disturbed
by dreams in which I see my husband and
which seem to promise his return. As long as my
son was a child I had to keep our home; but now
that he has grown to be a man, I am afraid that he
is angry with me that I do not wed another and go
away. For he suffers most from the squandered
riches and I can never hope to replace his wasted
fortune. My parents also urge me to yield myself.
Last night I had a strange dream. In the
courtyard are twenty geese which I feed and take
pleasure in. In my dream an eagle came flying
from the mountains, killed them all, and flew away.
And when I lamented and my women came to comfort
me, behold it returned, perched on the housetop,
and spoke with human voice: &lsquo;Courage, daughter
of Icarius, this is no empty dream, for it shall be
fulfilled. The geese are the suitors and I am thy
husband come to avenge thee and me.&rsquo; I was so
frightened that I awoke. Quickly I went to the
window, and there were my geese feeding from the
trough as usual.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In truth, noble queen,&rdquo; replied Ulysses, &ldquo;the
dream is plain enough. Believe me, destruction
shall suddenly overtake the suitors.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_135">135</div>
<p>&ldquo;Alas, good stranger, all dreams are not to be
trusted,&rdquo; answered Penelope. &ldquo;To-morrow is the
fateful day which I have appointed for the contest.
I have determined to propose a trial of skill, and shall
be obliged to take the winner for my husband. The
favorite bow of Ulysses shall be brought forth, and
the suitors shall try their skill at bending it. And
alas, I must leave the palace of my glorious husband
with the successful one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The stranger signified his approval, while he inwardly
rejoiced at the opportunity this would give
him to overcome all the suitors. The noble Penelope
ascended to her chamber, but Ulysses remained by
the fireside in the hall.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_136">136</div>
<h2 id="c14"><span class="h2line1">Chapter XIV</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">Penelope arranges the Decisive Contest</span></h2>
<p>Ulysses turned restlessly upon his couch,
when suddenly his divine friend Athene
stood beside him, asking gently: &ldquo;Why is
thine heart so heavy? Surely thou canst trust the
goddess who has protected thee in all dangers?
If fifty companies of suitors fought against thee,
thou shouldst lightly overcome them all. Sleep,
for the goddess bids thee hope.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He slept, but before dawn heart-rending sobs and
cries awakened him. It was Penelope&rsquo;s voice, weeping
and crying out Ulysses&rsquo; name a hundred times. A
vivid dream had roused her: Ulysses in full armor
lay beside her. Now was her rest gone and her
tears flowed afresh. The heart of the valiant
Ulysses was ready to break. He arose. It was
dark and the stars were shining. He went to the
window, and raising his hands, prayed: &ldquo;Father
Jupiter, if thou art gracious to me, grant me now a
sign, that I may have faith.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_137">137</div>
<p>And listen! A long peal of thunder echoed from
the eastern sky, and at the same moment he heard
the servant who was grinding corn say to herself:
&ldquo;Holy Father Jupiter, thou thunderest loudly,
though the heavens are clear and starry! It must
be that thou givest a sign. Oh, that thou wouldst
hear my prayer, that this might be the last night
on which I shall toil for the miserable suitors, who
devour by day with laughter what we poor slaves
must prepare in the sweat of our brows during the
night. Oh, that they might all die and this be their
last banquet!&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Ulysses heard this his courage suddenly
rose. He paced the great hall, turning over plans
in his mind and awaiting morning impatiently.
When it came, everyone about the house was busy.
Telemachus went to the market place and Euryclea
called the maids together to plan their work
for them. &ldquo;For,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;the suitors will assemble
early to-day to celebrate the feast of the
new moon.&rdquo; The swineherd came in early, driving
his contribution for the day&mdash;three fat pigs&mdash;and
he at once sought the stranger from Crete.
Ulysses went to meet him and pressed his hand
kindly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How dost thou fare? Dost stand in better
repute with the company?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, that the gods might destroy them for all
the grievous mischief which they hourly commit,&rdquo;
replied Ulysses.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_138">138</div>
<p>The goatherd Melantheus now came along and
could not pass the stranger without threatening
and insulting him. Next came Phil&oelig;tius, a master-herdsman.
He, too, like good Eum&aelig;us, hated the
suitors at heart and would long ago have gone away
had not love for Ulysses&rsquo; house detained him, and a
fear lest the herds might fall into bad hands. He
saw the beggar standing in the courtyard, and going
to the swineherd he asked him softly: &ldquo;Good
Eum&aelig;us, who is the strange man there? He
appears like a king, although bowed down by misery.&rdquo;
Speaking thus, he approached Ulysses, offering
his hand and speaking cordial words to him.</p>
<p>While they were talking together, the suitors,
who had assembled as usual in the market place,
were making new plots against the life of Telemachus,
whose bold tongue was becoming daily
more threatening. Amphinomus tried to dissuade
them, and for the present they agreed to let him
go. The noisy crew now stormed into the palace.
In the hall each laid aside his mantle. Then they
offered up fat goats, young lambs, and fatted boars
and beeves; others mixed the wine. While they
were eating Telemachus placed a table for the old
man at the door and gave him food and drink. In
the midst of their sport the suitors could scarcely
curb their insolence. A young fellow, son of a
rich father in Same, now called out loudly to the
company: &ldquo;Listen, ye generous suitors, the stranger
at the door has indeed had his portion of the feast,
but I shall now present him with a special gift.
He may give it to the maid who prepared his bath
or any of the servants. See this splendid bull&rsquo;s
hoof. May it agree with him!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_139">139</div>
<p>He threw it swiftly at Ulysses&rsquo; head, who jumped
aside and avoided it cleverly. The suitors roared
with laughter, in which Ulysses joined while nursing
rage in his heart. Telemachus sprang up like a
flame, crying angrily: &ldquo;It is fortunate for thee,
Ktesippus, that thou didst not strike the stranger,
or I should have pierced thee with my lance, that
thy father might have celebrated thy burial feast
instead of thy wedding. And I advise no one to
try anything more of that kind, for I will not permit
it. That you consume my flocks and herds is bad
enough, and ye may even murder me, as ye design&mdash;do
so! I would rather die than see strangers
abused in my house! Even my noble mother&rsquo;s
maidens have ye not spared!&rdquo;</p>
<p>All were silent until Agelaus began: &ldquo;Friends, I
am glad that ye do not reply, for Telemachus is
not entirely wrong. But I should like to give thee
some advice, Telemachus. Now that thou art
grown and able to manage thy house, thou shouldst
speak with thy mother and urge her to proceed to
the choice of a husband as soon as possible, for there
is certainly no longer any hope that thy father will
return. When she has left thy house thou canst
enjoy thy substance in peace, and none of us will
further disturb thee in the possession of thy herds
and acres.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, by Jupiter,&rdquo; replied Telemachus, &ldquo;I do
not prevent my mother&rsquo;s choice. She may take
whom she will. But far be it from me to drive my
mother from the house by any hasty word or to
compel her to a choice!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_140">140</div>
<p>Athene touched the suitors with madness. They
laughed until their faces were distorted, while
Ulysses, Telemachus, and the servants looked on
with horror. But Theoclymenus, the stranger seer
from Pylos, cried aloud as in an ecstasy of prophecy:
&ldquo;Unhappy men, what has come over you? Your
eyes are veiled, your heads are bruised, and your
cheeks wet with unnatural tears. Ha, I see blood!
It drips from the walls! It stands in pools! The
courtyard is full of shadows, hastening out into the
darkness of the spirit land. The sun is extinguished&mdash;a
horrible darkness reigneth!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The wild laughter arose once more. The suitors
only grew noisier in their rash blindness. The early
meal was partaken of in a wild turmoil, and not one
suspected what awaited them in the evening.</p>
<p>When afternoon came the noble Penelope remembered
her purpose of inviting the suitors to a trial
of skill, and ascended to the chamber where the
treasures of her dear lord were kept. His favorite
bow, of pliant horn, was hanging there, dusty and
unsightly, for it had not been touched for twenty
years. Penelope&rsquo;s tears fell upon her dear lord&rsquo;s
weapon as she took it down from the wall and
brushed away the dust. She sat down, laid it
across her knees, and sobbed aloud. When her
grief had spent itself she left the chamber with the
bow in her hands, followed by her maidens carrying
the heavy quiver, full of arrows.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_141">141</div>
<p>She entered the portal of the hall of columns
modestly wrapped in her long veil. Beside her
stood an attendant maiden. She spoke: &ldquo;Come,
ye brave suitors who gather in my house daily to
dance and feast and who pretend to woo me. Hear
me and listen to the trial which he must stand who
would become my husband. Here are the bow and
arrows of my dear lord, Ulysses, and here the rings.
Him will I follow as spouse who can most easily
bend the bow and shoot through the twelve rings.
My dear son shall lose his patrimony through no
fault of mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She gave the weapon to Eum&aelig;us to carry into
the hall, and when the good man held the well-known
bow in his hands, he began to weep and
kiss the weapon. Phil&oelig;tius also wept, for at the
sight of the bow the memory of his beloved master
overcame him. Antinous snarled at the faithful
creatures and bade them quickly bring in the bow.</p>
<p>The company now betook themselves to the hall,
where Telemachus deftly planted the axes in the
ground, so that they formed rings at regular distances
from one another. He then went to the
threshold and took up the weapon. &ldquo;It is a splendid
sport,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I have a great mind to try it
myself.&rdquo; He lifted the bow to bend it, but in vain.
After resting a moment he tried again, but neither
did he succeed this time. He drew it for the third
time and would certainly have succeeded, but his
father made a secret sign to him. He leant the
bow against the wall in pretended discouragement
and said: &ldquo;Either I am a miserable weakling or
else too young. But the rest of you must now try
it and end the contest.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_142">142</div>
<p>Leiodes stepped forward, but his arms fell when
he tried to draw the bow. One after another tried
it, and one after another set it down unbent. They
rubbed the horn with fat and warmed it at the fire
to render it more pliable, and still it was not bent.
By chance the two herdsmen went out together and
Ulysses quickly followed them and drew them aside.
&ldquo;Friends, a word,&rdquo; he whispered. &ldquo;Ye are both
honest fellows and faithful, and long to have your
master back. And now, if he should come and
needed your assistance, would ye defend the suitors
or brave Ulysses? Show me your hearts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If Jupiter would but grant me this wish,&rdquo; cried
the herdsman, &ldquo;thou shouldst see what my arms
can do!&rdquo; &ldquo;And mine!&rdquo; added the honest swineherd.
&ldquo;Oh, that it might come true!&rdquo; &ldquo;It has
come true!&rdquo; said Ulysses with majesty. &ldquo;Your
master is here and counts on you. I am Ulysses!
Do ye remember the wound I once received from the
wild boar? Here is the scar.&rdquo; They recognized
the mark and fell upon his neck and kissed his
cheeks and shoulders joyfully. But Ulysses commanded
them to control their joy before they should
be discovered.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_143">143</div>
<p>&ldquo;Listen to my plan,&rdquo; he said hurriedly, &ldquo;and
learn what you must do. It must be now or never.
The gods will assist me, and you, honest friends,
when all is finished, shall be to me as Telemachus&rsquo;
brothers. I will bestow riches and lands upon
you. Only do as I tell you. When we go back
I shall demand the bow, and no doubt the suitors
will object. But do thou, Eum&aelig;us, pay no attention,
but go and fetch it. Then go out and tell the
old nurse to shut up all the women in their quarters.
Thou, Phil&oelig;tius, hasten thou to close the
doors of the house and put up the bars that none of
the suitors may escape. I will now go in. Follow
me, but singly and quietly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Ulysses re&euml;ntered the hall and seated himself
in his old place by the door, the bow had just
reached the hands of Eurymachus, who was sitting
by the hearth seeking to make it more pliant with
grease and the warmth of the fire. He then made
trial of it ten times, but could not draw. At last,
much discomfited, he laid it down. The boastful
Antinous, who was no longer anxious to try his
skill, proposed to wait until the morrow, this being
a feast day. &ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;we will make
sacrifice to Apollo and try the bow once more. Now
fill up the cups, for to-day is a feast day and we must
drink a double portion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This speech pleased everyone and the servants did
as they were bid. When drinking had been resumed,
Ulysses arose and began: &ldquo;Listen to me, ye suitors
of the esteemed princess, and especially ye two
lords, Antinous and Eurymachus, I would make a
proposal to you in jest. As ye do not care to bend
the bow on this day of the feast, let me try it and
see if any of my youthful strength remains, or if old
age and hardships have sapped it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_144">144</div>
<p>As he had expected, murmurs arose on all sides
and Antinous answered for the rest: &ldquo;Miserable
stranger, hast thou taken leave of thy senses? The
wine hath led thee to these unseemly words! Take
care that thou be not put aboard a ship and sent
to King Echetus, the scourge of strangers! There
wouldst thou hardly escape with nose and ears uncut.
Thou hadst better keep quiet and take what is given
thee, and leave such business to younger men.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penelope had remained in the hall with her ladies
to await the result of the contest and now she spoke.
&ldquo;Antinous, I think thou art not just. Why should
we omit the strangers who are our guests? Perchance
thou thinkest that if this man should draw
the bow that he would wed me? Let not this scruple
disturb thee, for that is impossible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, it is truly not that, noble Queen,&rdquo; said Eurymachus.
&ldquo;But we fear the tongues of men, should
a miserable wandering beggar man draw the bow
which all we younger men have been unable to bend.
It would be an eternal disgrace for us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Telemachus now arose and spoke with dignity
and emphasis. &ldquo;Mother, thou hast spoken well.
But no one in this house but I has a right to the bow,
and I shall give it to whom I will, and woe to him
who would hinder me. But do thou go up to thy
chamber, attend to thy duties there, and direct
the women servants. This is men&rsquo;s business and mine
most of all, for I am the head of the house.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_145">145</div>
<p>Wondering, she withdrew, musing upon the wise
words of her son. As she lay upon her couch she
wept for her dear lord, until Pallas Athene gently
closed her eyes in slumber. Meanwhile the swineherd,
who had been awaiting a sign from Ulysses,
boldly fetched the bow and handed it to him. The
suitors sprang from their seats as though they would
lay hands on him, but Telemachus cried in a threatening
voice: &ldquo;Thou hast done well, father&mdash;for
thou canst not obey all, and I am master here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A loud malicious shout of laughter followed these
words and their anger was dissipated. The swineherd
went directly to carry out the instructions
he had received. Phil&oelig;tius, also, stole forth to
close and bar the doors, then returned as quietly
and took up his post beside the swineherd.</p>
<p>The eyes of all the suitors were now turned toward
the beggar, who was turning the bow over and over
and examining it carefully to see whether worms
had perhaps eaten into the horn or it had suffered
other injury. Many a youth said to his neighbor:
&ldquo;See how the old man examines the bow. Perhaps
he has one like it at home or would make
one like it. See how he turns it about, the old
wiseacre.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ulysses next pushed his table aside, lifted the
mighty bow, and lightly as a minstrel touches the
strings of his harp, he picked the taut cord of his
bow, which responded with as fine a note as the twittering
of sparrows. At that moment a tremendous
thunderclap resounded through the house, making
all the suitors tremble; but the king exulted in the
favorable augury. He placed an arrow on the
string, and without leaving his seat or waiting to
take aim, he let it fly through the rings nor missed
a single one. The guests sat in silent astonishment
while he spoke to his son.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_146">146</div>
<p>&ldquo;Thou seest, Telemachus, thy guest brings thee
no disgrace. Indeed, I feel that my strength is
still unimpaired. But I think it is supper time.
Then let us amuse ourselves with song and lute.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He accompanied these words with a sign which
Telemachus understood. The youth went quickly
out and soon returned armed and placed himself,
expectant and darkly frowning, by his father&rsquo;s
chair, holding sword and shield in readiness for
him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_147">147</div>
<h2 id="c15"><span class="h2line1">Chapter XV</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">Ulysses&rsquo; Revenge</span></h2>
<p>Ulysses quickly arose. Girding up his
rags he threw the arrows to the ground
before him and sprang to the doorway,
drawing the bow. &ldquo;Now I will choose a different
mark,&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Let us see whether Apollo will
now grant me his favor!&rdquo; With this the death
shaft sped through Antinous&rsquo; neck, just as he had
taken up the golden cup to drink. The blood
gushed from his mouth as he fell convulsed to the
ground, overturning the table with the food and
wine. Immediately the hall was in an uproar. The
suitors vainly sought their weapons, crying: &ldquo;Woe
to thee, madman! Now thine hour is come and
vultures shall feast upon thy flesh!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The fools! They supposed that the hero had
hit Antinous by chance. But he soon undeceived
them, crying in thunder tones which caused their
hearts and knees to tremble: &ldquo;Ha! ye dogs! Ye
thought that I should ne&rsquo;er return and therefore
have ye squandered my substance, maltreated my
servants, and insulted my poor wife for these long
years with unprecedented insolence. Ye have feared
neither the punishment of the gods nor the disapproval
of mankind, but now the day of reckoning has
come!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_148">148</div>
<p>Horror seized the suitors, while Ulysses again
raised the bow and pierced the breast of Eurymachus
with his shaft ere he could draw his sword
and rush upon him. Telemachus with his spear
stood by his father&rsquo;s side to protect him, while he
sent arrow after arrow into the crowd and one
after another was struck down into the dust.</p>
<p>Telemachus fetched helmets, shields, and spears
for both the herdsmen, and they quickly armed
themselves. Melantheus, the goatherd, who had
more presence of mind than the rest, managed to
slip out of the side door unobserved and bring down
some of the weapons which Ulysses and Telemachus
had wisely hidden in the upper chambers. Ulysses
suddenly discovered that half of the front row of
men were armed and spears began to hurtle past
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is this?&rdquo; he cried in dismay to Telemachus.
&ldquo;One of the maids or Melantheus must have brought
them weapons. See how they defend themselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ye gods, it is all my fault,&rdquo; said Telemachus.
&ldquo;I left the door of the armory ajar and the crafty
goatherd has taken advantage of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;See, there he is sneaking out to fetch another
spear,&rdquo; cried Ulysses. &ldquo;Eum&aelig;us! Phil&oelig;tius! Follow
him! Bind him! Hang him up, while my son
and I fight on!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_149">149</div>
<p>When the suitors saw that Ulysses and Telemachus
were left alone they took fresh courage,
and it would have gone hard with the two against
the combined onset of their foes, had not Athene in
Mentor&rsquo;s form entered at the critical moment armed
from head to foot and thrown back the nearest
ones with a powerful blow of her shield.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mentor, cursed old man,&rdquo; screamed all the
suitors, &ldquo;do not dare to help these two men, for
when we shall have conquered them, then woe to
thee and thy house! Flee, while there is yet time!&rdquo;</p>
<p>This angered Pallas Athene, and she spurred
Ulysses on with encouraging words. He felt the
presence of the goddess and renewed his superhuman
efforts. The two herdsmen now returned
with a fresh supply of lances, and Mentor saw that
the rest of the task could be left to the brave men.</p>
<p>At last the greater part of the suitors had fallen.
Some had already breathed their last. Most of
them were writhing on the spears with which they
had been pierced and lay bathed in their own blood.
It was a horrible sight. As the four heroes prepared
to give the death blow to the few survivors, Leiodes
sprang suddenly from behind a column, and
clasping Ulysses&rsquo; knees, called loudly for mercy.
&ldquo;Give me my life,&rdquo; he prayed. &ldquo;I took no part
in the evil deeds of the suitors, for I was their priest
and only carried out the holy customs when they
sacrificed thy steers.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_150">150</div>
<p>&ldquo;If thou hast been their sacrificial priest and
prophet, thou must surely have foretold many
evil things concerning me and have called down
misfortunes upon my head in thy prayers. And for
this thou shalt die a well-deserved death,&rdquo; replied
the king with dark looks. He raised his sword and
with a quick stroke severed the head of the still-kneeling
priest, so that it rolled in the dust.</p>
<p>He searched all the hiding places, but did not
find another living soul, and contemplated with
astonishment and horror the frightful work of his
hands. Then at last he laid down his sword and
lifted the bronze helmet from his perspiring brow.
&ldquo;Be quick, Telemachus, and call my old nurse
Euryclea, that I may question her,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Telemachus brought the old woman. She raised
her hands and began to rejoice. But Ulysses stopped
her and said reprovingly: &ldquo;Hush, dame! At heart
thou mayest exult that justice has been done and
punishment meted out, but it is a sin to triumph
over fallen men. They have their reward, but it
is the gods who through me have accomplished their
will. Now tell me of the women in the house,
both those who have betrayed me and those who have
served faithfully.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gladly I obey thee,&rdquo; answered the old nurse.
&ldquo;Fifty women serve in the palace. Twelve have
proved unfaithful and left the paths of virtue, neither
obeying me, nor even the noble Penelope. But let
me slip upstairs and wake the queen. She knows
not of thy return, for a divinity has closed her eyes
in a leaden sleep. How surprised she will be!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay, mother, do not wake her yet. First command
the twelve refractory women hither.&rdquo; The
old woman hastened to obey.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_151">151</div>
<p>&ldquo;When they come,&rdquo; continued Ulysses to his son
and the two herdsmen, &ldquo;they shall first help us clean
the dwelling, and when that is done, take them out
to the outer courtyard, drive them all into the narrow
passageway, and strike them down with your
swords, so that their souls may join the shades of
the insolent suitors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While he was speaking the women entered, frightened
at the sight that met their eyes and trembling
for their own lives. &ldquo;Drag out the dead,&rdquo;
commanded Ulysses. &ldquo;Lay them outside in the
gallery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They took hold reluctantly, assisted by the herdsmen,
and Ulysses saw that all was properly done and
set in order, and then Telemachus and the herdsmen
conducted the women to their doom. After
this they sought out Melantheus and prepared a
terrible death for this base wretch.</p>
<p>The work of slaughter was now complete. The
herdsmen washed their hands and feet and went
back to the hall. Here Ulysses ordered Euryclea
to make a fire, fetch sulphur, and with its fumes to
turn away the curse from this house of slaughter.
The old servants now came crowding about their
master to kiss him joyfully. This touched his
heart and he pressed their hands in hearty greeting.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_152">152</div>
<h2 id="c16"><span class="h2line1">Chapter XVI</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">Ulysses reveals himself to Penelope</span></h2>
<p>Now at length Ulysses allowed the old nurse
to carry the news to his sleeping spouse.
Breathless she entered the chamber where
the queen slumbered. &ldquo;Penelope!&rdquo; she cried.
&ldquo;Awake, my daughter! This is no time for sleep!
He is here! Ulysses has come! All is over! Look
down into the court. There they all lie in heaps.
And hast thou heard nothing? Come quickly!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; cried Penelope, stretching herself and rubbing
her eyes; &ldquo;silly woman, how canst thou wake
me thus and with such a fairy tale? Wouldst thou
deceive me with false hopes? Oh, I slept so sweetly!
How canst thou play such a trick on me? Only
thine age protects thee from my anger.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not jesting, my daughter,&rdquo; answered the
old woman. &ldquo;He is here, and with Telemachus&rsquo; aid
has killed all the suitors. It happened whilst
thou slept.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mother, tell me the truth! How could he come
so quickly?&rdquo; She had sprung up and hung about
the old nurse&rsquo;s neck with anxious glances. Euryclea
laughed. &ldquo;He has been in the house since
yesterday and thou thyself hast spoken with him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What, Euryclea! The ragged old beggar?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_153">153</div>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed, yes. The beggar with the greasy wallet
whom the suitors made sport of. If they had
but known!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alas, mother, how disappointed I am. That is
not my husband. No, that is not Ulysses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not Ulysses? Child, you are strange. I knew
it last evening when I washed his feet and recognized
the great scar&mdash;you remember it&mdash;from the
boar&rsquo;s tusk. But he would not allow me to speak.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It cannot be! It cannot be!&rdquo; repeated Penelope.
&ldquo;But tell me what has happened?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then Euryclea had to tell the whole story of
what she had seen and heard of the horrible massacre.
&ldquo;Thy long-desired, beloved husband is below
and awaits thee, daughter. Come quickly to
embrace him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, mother, do not rejoice too soon. Thou
knowest how I long for Ulysses, but I know the gods.
They often wander about over the earth to reward
the good, surprise the wicked, and punish long-continued
evils. If the suitors are really killed, it must
have been by a god, whom my misery has touched.
How could a mere man, even though he were stronger
and bolder than Ulysses, undertake so unequal a
task? I did indeed admire the stranger&rsquo;s mind, but
he did not remind me of Ulysses. No, that was not
my vigorous, impetuous husband. But I will go
and view the horrible scene and talk with my son.
If the stranger is my husband I shall know him
by secret signs. But if he is a god, as I believe, we
will sacrifice before him and worship him.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_154">154</div>
<p>They descended and entered the hall, where they
found Ulysses sitting by the fire leaning against a
pillar. He did not look up, but waited for what
his wife would say. She sat opposite him a long
time in silence. Sometimes, as she looked earnestly
at him, she thought it was he; then when she
looked upon his rags, she could not believe it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mother,&rdquo; cried Telemachus, &ldquo;hast thou no greeting
for my father? Thou hast a heart in thy breast
that is indeed harder than a stone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear son,&rdquo; answered his mother, &ldquo;thou dost
me a wrong. I am dumb with astonishment. I
cannot grasp the miracle and do not venture to address
this wonderful man nor to look in his face.
But if he is really my Ulysses, we shall soon recognize
each other. We have secret signs between us
that none others know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My son,&rdquo; said Ulysses, smiling gently, &ldquo;let
thy mother study me a while longer. She certainly
has reason to doubt me clad in these ugly rags.
But now let us consult together how we may conceal
the death of the suitors from the people to-day, for
they all have relations and retainers who will seek
to avenge them. We have killed not one, but one
hundred. How shall we save ourselves?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear father,&rdquo; replied the modest son, &ldquo;thou
must know, for no mortal is as wise as thou. It
shall be as thou sayest. We will follow thee and aid
thee as far as we are able.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_155">155</div>
<p>&ldquo;Then I will tell thee, what seems wise to me,&rdquo;
answered the resourceful Ulysses. &ldquo;Let each one
go first to the bath and put on his best garments.
Let the women also don their holiday robes, as is
seemly on the day of their master&rsquo;s return. The
gifted minstrel must strike his harp, that all the passers
by may suppose that Penelope is celebrating her
marriage day. Then early in the morning we will
leave the house and flee to Laertes&rsquo; country-place,
where the gods shall give us further counsel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The household at once carried out all these commands,
and soon the hall, which an hour before had
resounded with the deadly blows of Ulysses&rsquo; spear,
and had looked like a bloody battlefield, was filled
with gay strains of song and music of the lute.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Ulysses, too, had gone to rid himself
of his dirt and ugly rags. The old housekeeper
conducted him to a warm bath and afterward
anointed his head with precious oil. And behold, as
he left the bath the goddess Athene suddenly clothed
him with beauty, so that he appeared taller and
stronger. The bald crown disappeared and his
head was once more crowned with shining brown
locks. His cheeks became rosy and the fire returned
to the dull eyes. Blinded by the miracle, the housekeeper
presented him the handsome tunic and cloak,
and thus the conqueror re&euml;ntered the hall in the guise
of a king and hero. Everything was hushed, while
all eyes gazed at the newcomer in admiration.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_156">156</div>
<p>Joyfully Penelope sprang up. Yes, this was
her Ulysses, just as he had left her. But was it
not a delusion? Doubting she sank back in her
chair. But Ulysses stepped before her and held
out his arms joyously. &ldquo;Now wilt thou not accept
me again for thy husband, dear wife?&rdquo; he cried.
&ldquo;What! Thou art not ready? Alas, in vain have
I longed for thee! Go, Eurynome, make ready my
couch, that I may sorrowfully retire to rest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do so, good mother,&rdquo; said Penelope. &ldquo;Set
his bed out of our chamber wherever thou wilt and
prepare it with fine soft covers and skins.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was the test by which the queen could recognize
her husband. Ulysses had once built a sleeping
chamber about the trunk of a great olive tree
which stood in the court and had built the couch
hard and fast into the trunk of the tree, so that
no one could have carried it out until he should
first chop down the tree.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Someone has destroyed my sleeping chamber,
if the bed may be carried out,&rdquo; cried Ulysses. &ldquo;And
I had joined it so well to the trunk of the olive
tree.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="caption"><i>ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO PENELOPE</i></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_157">157</div>
<p>Penelope burst into tears at these words and she
trembled. &ldquo;Ulysses, my dear Ulysses!&rdquo; she cried
as she threw her arms about his neck and covered
his face with a thousand tender kisses. &ldquo;Now I
know it is thee, for no one in this house knoweth
the secret but thyself and me. And now welcome,
my precious husband, for whom I have wept a
thousand sleepless nights, praying to the gods for
thy safe return. Welcome! Welcome! But do
not be angry with me because I did not know thee
at once, nor trust the first assurance like a giddy
young girl. There are so many crafty deceivers.
Ah, hadst thou been able to see the struggle in my
heart while I was burning to embrace thee. My
seeming coldness was only caused by the innumerable
sufferings due to my mighty love.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Their tears mingled, and Penelope lay upon the
heart of her newly found lord in silent rapture,
her emotion expressing itself only in deep sighs.
Midnight was long past when Eurynome brought
her torch to guide them to their rest.</p>

<br /><span class="h2line2">Ulysses goes to Laertes&mdash;His Father&rsquo;s Conflict with the Friends of the slain Suitors&mdash;Great Sacrifice and Festival in Ithaca</span></h2>
<p>Before dawn, after a few hours of sleep,
Ulysses arose and awakened his wife,
Telemachus, and the herdsmen. &ldquo;Come
quickly, friends,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;that we may reach my
father&rsquo;s plantation before daylight. Very soon
the news of the death of the suitors will spread
throughout the island, and the princes whose sons
have not returned at night will set out to seek them.
If they all unite and lead their people against us,
we shall not be able to withstand them. Therefore
we will conceal ourselves in Laertes&rsquo; distant
garden in the country. Some god will then tell us
what further course to pursue. But thou, Penelope,
do thou remain here until I summon thee.
Ascend to the upper chambers with thy maidens
and stay quietly there, for their vengeance will not
touch thee.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_159">159</div>
<p>When he had finished speaking, the men took
up their weapons and hastened away. With the
first rays of the sun they entered the enclosure that
surrounded old Laertes&rsquo; country-seat. His house
stood in front, surrounded by the farm buildings.
The men were away at work, but Laertes was in
the orchard, which he loved and where he himself
labored every day. Telemachus explained to the
servants that he had brought a stranger who
wished to speak with the old king.</p>
<p>To Telemachus and the two herdsmen Ulysses
spoke aside. &ldquo;Remain ye here and prepare a select
fattened pig for a sacrifice. Meanwhile I will go
alone to my father and see if he know me. Then I
will bring him here and we will eat together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ulysses found his father spading round a pear
tree in the well-ordered orchard. He was so busy
that he did not perceive the new arrival. Ulysses&rsquo;
heart contracted at the sight. His father was clad
in a dirty tunic, coarse and well mended. He had
bound pieces of oxhide about hands and ankles to
protect them from thorns, and he wore a cap of
goatskin to shield his bald head from the cold morning
air. He finally rose from his work and saw the
well-dressed stranger standing before him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Greeting to thee, old man,&rdquo; said Ulysses.
&ldquo;What good care thou takest of thy garden. Thy
trees and vines look flourishing. Only thyself, it
seems to me, art neglected. What niggardly master
keeps thee so poorly and allows thee to go about
ragged as a beggar? Tell me, where am I? I would
inquire the way to the palace of Ulysses. I wish
to see the gallant hero; he was my guest upon his
travels, and as my way lay past Ithaca I have laid
by my ship to visit my dear friend.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_160">160</div>
<p>&ldquo;Alas, good stranger,&rdquo; replied Laertes, &ldquo;thou
hast come too soon. Who knows what monster
of the deep hath swallowed him or upon what shore
his bones are bleaching. It is ten years since Troy
was destroyed, and since then we have watched and
waited for him daily, and I most of all. For know,
that the old man who stands before thee here, dignified
by sorrow, is Laertes, father of the noble
Ulysses. His mother died of a broken heart, but
to me the gods have denied this boon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Worthy king,&rdquo; replied Ulysses, &ldquo;weep no more.
The gods have rejoicing in store for thee. Living
thou shalt behold thy son.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alas, do not encourage false hopes. What
knowest thou of him? Speak, man, if thou canst
tell aught. Where hast thou seen him and how
long since?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;About five years,&rdquo; answered Ulysses. &ldquo;But
hast thou heard nothing of the rumors which are
abroad? Men say that Ulysses has returned and
found his house full of rude guests who squandered
his fortune and wooed his wife; that he has destroyed
them through craft or violence, and is once more
master in his own house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, that it were so,&rdquo; lamented the old man.
&ldquo;Speak! Art thou a divine messenger and bringest
me true tidings?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Noble king,&rdquo; now spake Ulysses with trembling
voice, scarce able to control his tears, &ldquo;is it not true
that thou didst once give that fig tree there to thy
son when he was a boy?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_161">161</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And this splendid row of pear trees also?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that thou didst often walk among these
hedges in friendly talk with him, telling him the
name and use of each bush?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes&mdash;!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How he will rejoice when he returns to find thee
in thy old haunts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But ye gods! How dost thou know this? Thine
eyes shine! Thou tremblest? Yes, thou art Ulysses,
my son! By Jupiter, it is he!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, father, it is thy son. Oh, contain thyself.
Take care, father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Laertes now cried aloud: &ldquo;If thou art really my
son Ulysses returned, give me a sign, a convincing
token, by which I may know thee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Examine this scar which the boar gave me
upon Parnassus,&rdquo; answered Ulysses gayly. &ldquo;Thou
and my loving mother didst send me to grandsire
Autolycus to fetch the gifts which he had
promised me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man&rsquo;s knees trembled when he recognized
the mark. Quickly he embraced his beloved son,
who covered his face with kisses. And then Ulysses
told his whole story down to the killing of the suitors.
When he had finished, Laertes cried: &ldquo;Now I see
that you still reign, ye immortal gods. For at last
these horrid deeds have been avenged. But, my
son, how wilt thou escape the vengeance which such
a bloody exploit will bring upon thee?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_162">162</div>
<p>&ldquo;Let not that trouble thee,&rdquo; answered Ulysses.
&ldquo;If the love of the people does not protect me, the
spirit of Tiresias has promised me a place of refuge
in the interior of the mainland, where a peaceful
and happy old age awaits me. But now let us go
down to the palace, where Telemachus and my
faithful servants await us, and thou shalt clothe
thyself as befits a king.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When all was in readiness, the happy company
sat down to eat together. In the meanwhile rumors
of the terrible fate which had overtaken the suitors
spread through the city. Their fathers and relatives
hastened to the crowded market place to inflame
the people. Eupithes, father of Antinous,
who had cherished the hope above all others that his
son was to be the successful wooer of the beautiful
Penelope and ruler over all Ithaca, was the leader.
He gained over many of the people by his eloquent
pleadings, but others held back, especially after
listening to Medon and Halitherses.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Friends,&rdquo; said the former, &ldquo;believe me, Ulysses
did not do this tremendous deed without the help
of the gods. I myself saw the divinity in Mentor&rsquo;s
form standing beside him and turning aside the
spears. Even before the shaking of her shield,
numbers fell before him. Do not oppose him or ye
will fight against offended gods.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, ye Ithacans, do not take up arms against
him. Let him alone,&rdquo; said the cautious old Halitherses.
&ldquo;He has but fulfilled the vengeance of
the gods.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_163">163</div>
<p>Many agreed with this and went quietly home.
But the friends of the suitors and followers of
Eupithes armed themselves and hastened from the
palace to Laertes&rsquo; gardens, where they found the
household under arms and ready to receive them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, this is a happy day,&rdquo; cried the valiant
Laertes, &ldquo;when I may fight together with my son
and grandson.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now the goddess Pallas Athene, in Mentor&rsquo;s
shape, approached and breathed courage into him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, noble Laertes,&rdquo; cried the goddess, &ldquo;thou
shalt open this illustrious battle and cast the first
lance at the enemy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a prayer to Jupiter he hurled the first spear,
and see! it pierces the bronze armor and enters
Eupithes&rsquo; breast. At the same moment a fiery
bolt sent by Jove and accompanied by a roar of
thunder struck the earth between the combatants.
This terrible omen, together with the fall of their
leader, robbed the enemy of their courage and
reason.</p>
<p>Then the goddess stepped forth and called to
the combatants in a loud voice: &ldquo;Men of Ithaca,
desist! Give up this unhappy war which displeases
the gods! Shed no more blood and depart quickly
hence!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_164">164</div>
<p>Upon this no one dared speak of revenge, and even
the bravest warriors put away their weapons with
the resolve never to use them against the man who
had right upon his side. Time, by degrees, dulled
the hatred even of the fathers of the murdered men.
The wisdom, magnanimity, and kindness of Ulysses
soon won all hearts and at last converted even his
bitterest foes into friends.</p>
<p>Ulysses did not forget the vow which he had made
in the kingdom of departed souls, to the gods of
Hades, to offer in sacrifice a young ox and, to the
spirit of Tiresias, a black ram when he should be at
home once more. Both victims were brought forth,
and while the heralds were preparing the feast for
the people, Ulysses gave the death stroke to the
animals. While the fat pieces were burning on the
altar, he prayed solemnly, with uplifted hands:
&ldquo;Holy gods of Hades, here in my kingdom I thus
gratefully fulfil the vow I made in yours. I have
surmounted many difficulties and often barely escaped
with my life, always trusting in a fortunate
outcome. And now, ye gracious gods, I can look
back gratefully upon my past. Often will I renew
this offering, for one should remember the dead
gladly, nor ever shun the goddess of death and fate.
But wherever destiny may lead me, oh grant that
I may rule the people gloriously and in peace, and
that the name of the illustrious Ulysses may live
among future generations of men.&rdquo;</p>

States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm

specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are

check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work

phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project

Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the

volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
